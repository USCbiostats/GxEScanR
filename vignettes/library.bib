abstract = {Many complex diseases are likely to be a result of the interplay of genes and environmental exposures. The standard analysis in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) scans for main effects and ignores the potentially useful information in the available exposure data. Two recently proposed methods that exploit environmental exposure information involve a two-step analysis aimed at prioritizing the large number of SNPs tested to highlight those most likely to be involved in a G × E interaction. For example, Murcray et al. ([2009] Am J Epidemiol 169:219–226) proposed screening on a test that models the G-E association induced by an interaction in the combined case-control sample. Alternatively, Kooperberg and LeBlanc ([2008] Genet Epidemiol 32:255–263) suggested screening on genetic marginal effects. In both methods, SNPs that pass the respective screening step at a pre-specified significance threshold are followed up with a formal test of interaction in the second step. We propose a hybrid method that combines these two screening approaches by allocating a proportion of the overall genome-wide significance level to each test. We show that the Murcray et al. approach is often the most efficient method, but that the hybrid approach is a powerful and robust method for nearly any underlying model. As an example, for a GWAS of 1 million markers including a single true disease SNP with minor allele frequency of 0.15, and a binary exposure with prevalence 0.3, the Murcray, Kooperberg and hybrid methods are 1.90, 1.27, and 1.87 times as efficient, respectively, as the traditional case-control analysis to detect an interaction effect size of 2.0.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Significant debate continues over the efficacy of drotrecogin alpha activated (DAA) in sepsis. This updated meta-analysis provides an updated summary effect estimate and explores the reasons for outcome heterogeneity in placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials of DAA on 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Computer searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, published abstracts from major intensive care meetings and examination of reference lists were used to identify five placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials with 7260 patients. The primary endpoint was 28-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were 28-day incidence of severe bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: DAA was not associated with improved 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (pooled relative risk (RR) of 0.97 [95{\%} CI 0.83-1.14]), and is associated with an increase in serious bleeding. The significant heterogeneity in the pooled RR for 28-day mortality (I2 value of 59.4{\%}, $\chi$2 P-value 0.043) is no longer present with exclusion of the post-study amendment portion of PROWESS (I2 value of 0{\%}, $\chi$2 P-value 0.44 without PROWESS post-amendment). Using meta-regression, the best ranked predictor of outcome heterogeneity was baseline mortality in the placebo arm, which was among the highest in PROWESS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: DAA is not associated with improved survival in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Further studies should be done to determine whether changes in supportive therapy for sepsis explain the variable efficacy of DAA in randomized controlled clinical trials observed over time.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. SUMMARY The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. There-fore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {Background: Greater red meat intake is associated with an increased type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk. However, the relation of red meat intake to biomarkers of inflammation and glucose metabolism has not been investigated thoroughly.Objective: We hypothesized that greater red meat intake would be associated with biomarkers of inflammation and glucose metabolism, which would be partly explained by body mass index (BMI).Design: We analyzed cross-sectional data from diabetes-free female participants in the Nurses' Health Study (n = 3690). Multiple linear regression was conducted to assess the associations of total, unprocessed, and processed red meat intakes (quartile categories) with plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, adiponectin, fasting insulin, and hemoglobin A1c (Hb A1c).Results: Greater total, unprocessed, and processed red meat intakes were associated with higher plasma CRP, ferritin, fasting insulin, and Hb A1c and lower adiponectin after adjustment for demographic information (P-trend ≤ 0.03 for all). Adiponectin was not associated with any type of red meat intake when further adjusted for medical and lifestyle factors. After adjustment for BMI, most of these associations with inflammatory and glucose metabolic biomarkers were substantially attenuated and no longer significant. BMI accounted for a statistically significant proportion of associations with CRP, Hb A1c, and fasting insulin (P-contribution ≤ 0.02 for all) but not with ferritin. Substituting a serving of total red meat intake with alternative protein food in a combination of poultry, fish, legumes, and nuts was associated with significantly lower CRP ($\beta$ ± SE: −0.106 ± 0.043), ferritin (−0.212 ± 0.075), Hb A1c (−0.052 ± 0.015), and fasting insulin (−0.119 ± 0.036) (all P ≤ 0.02 for comparison of extreme quartiles for all).Conclusions: Greater red meat intake is associated with unfavorable plasma concentrations of inflammatory and glucose metabolic biomarkers in diabetes-free women. BMI accounts for a significant proportion of the associations with these biomarkers, except for ferritin. Substituting red meat with another protein food is associated with a healthier biomarker profile of inflammatory and glucose metabolism. },

abstract = {Background: Red meat and processed meat consumption have been associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer in some, but not all, relevant cohort studies. Evidence on the relationship between risk of colorectal cancer and poultry and fish consumption is inconsistent. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 37,112 residents of Melbourne, Australia recruited from 1990 to 1994. Diet was measured with a food frequency questionnaire. We categorized the frequency of fresh red meat, processed meat, chicken, and fish consumption into approximate quartiles. Adenocarcinomas of the colon or rectum were ascertained via the Victorian Cancer Registry. Results: We identified 283 colon cancers and 169 rectal cancers in an average of 9 years of follow-up. For rectal cancer, the hazard ratios [95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI)] in the highest quartile of consumption of fresh red meat and processed meat were 2.3 (1.2-4.2; P for trend = 0.07) and 2.0 (1.1-3.4; P for trend = 0.09), respectively. The corresponding hazard ratios (95{\%} CIs) for colon cancer were 1.1 (0.7-1.6; P for trend = 0.9) and 1.3 (0.9-1.9; P for trend = 0.06). However, for neither type of meat was the heterogeneity between subsites significant. Chicken consumption was weakly negatively associated with colorectal cancer (hazard ratio highest quartile, 0.7; 95{\%} CI, 0.6-1.0; P for trend = 0.03), whereas hazard ratios for fish consumption were close to unity. Conclusion: Consumption of fresh red meat and processed meat seemed to be associated with an increased risk of rectal cancer. Consumption of chicken and fish did not increase risk.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The appropriate handling of missing covariate data in prognostic modelling studies is yet to be conclusively determined. A resampling study was performed to investigate the effects of different missing data methods on the performance of a prognostic model.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Observed data for 1000 cases were sampled with replacement from a large complete dataset of 7507 patients to obtain 500 replications. Five levels of missingness (ranging from 5{\%} to 75{\%}) were imposed on three covariates using a missing at random (MAR) mechanism. Five missing data methods were applied; a) complete case analysis (CC) b) single imputation using regression switching with predictive mean matching (SI), c) multiple imputation using regression switching imputation, d) multiple imputation using regression switching with predictive mean matching (MICE-PMM) and e) multiple imputation using flexible additive imputation models. A Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to each dataset and estimates for the regression coefficients and model performance measures obtained.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: CC produced biased regression coefficient estimates and inflated standard errors (SEs) with 25{\%} or more missingness. The underestimated SE after SI resulted in poor coverage with 25{\%} or more missingness. Of the MI approaches investigated, MI using MICE-PMM produced the least biased estimates and better model performance measures. However, this MI approach still produced biased regression coefficient estimates with 75{\%} missingness.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Very few differences were seen between the results from all missing data approaches with 5{\%} missingness. However, performing MI using MICE-PMM may be the preferred missing data approach for handling between 10{\%} and 50{\%} MAR missingness.},

abstract = {The mu (GSTM1 and theta (GSTT1) members of the glutathione S-transferase multigene family are candidate cancer susceptibility genes because of their ability to regulate the conjugation of carcinogenic compounds to excretable hydrophilic metabolites. Deletion variants that are associated with a lack of enzyme function exist at both these loci. Individuals who are carriers of homozygous deletions in the GSTM1 of GSTT1 genes may have an impaired ability to metabolically eliminate carcinogenic compounds and may therefore be at increased cancer risk. Molecular epidemiological studies have provided three pieces of information about the relationship of GSTM1 and GSTT1 with cancer susceptibility. First, the frequencies of homozygous GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletion carriers is very high (i.e., 20-50{\%}) in most populations studied to date. Second, GSTM1 and, possibly, GSTT1 may be involved in the etiology of cancer at more than one site. Third, the risk conferred to individuals who carry homozygous deletions in GSTM1 and GSTT1 appears to be small in magnitude. (e.g., odds ration of {\textless} 2). However, the magnitude of risk is larger (e.g., odds ratio of 3-5) when interactions of GSTM1 of GSTT1 with other factors (e.g., cigarette smoking) are considered. These findings have implications for studies of GSTM1 and GSTT1 in cancer susceptibility and for future applications of these biomarkers in cancer prevention of control strategies. First, molecular epidemiological studies should consider both the common frequency of deletion genotypes and the relatively low cancer risk these deletion genotypes may impart. For example, the common frequency of deletion variants may improve statistical power in some molecular epidemiological studies, but large samples may still be required to detect relatively small effect sizes or important interaction effects. Second, the fact that deletion genotypes are common implies that the proportion of cancer attributable to these variants may be large in the general population. However, these genotypes may be less suited for individual cancer risk assessment because of their relatively small contribution to the absolute risk of cancer.},

abstract = {The metabolic activation pathways associated with carcinogenic aromatic and heterocyclic amines have long been known to involve N-oxidation, catalyzed primarily by cytochrome P4501A2, and subsequent O-esterification, often catalyzed by acetyltransferases (NATs) and sulfotransferases (SULTs). We have found a new enzymatic mechanism of carcinogen detoxification: a microsomal NADH-dependent reductase that rapidly converts the N-hydroxy arylamine back to the parent amine. The following N-OH-arylamines and N-OH-heterocyclic amines were rapidly reduced by both human and rat liver microsomes: N-OH-4-aminoazobenzene, N-OH-4-aminobiphenyl (N-OH-ABP), N-OH-aniline, N-OH-2-naphthylamine, N-OH-2-aminofluorene, N-OH-4,4'-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (N-OH-MOCA), N-OH-1-naphthyamine, N-OH-2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (N-OH-PhIP), N-OH-2-amino-$\alpha$-carboline (N-OH-A$\alpha$C), N-OH-2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (N-OH-MeIQx), and N-OH-2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (N-OH-IQ). In addition, primary rat hepatocytes and human HepG2 cells efficiently reduced N-OH-PhIP to PhIP. This previously unrecognized detoxification pathway may limit the bioavailability of carcinogenic N-OH heterocyclic and aromatic amines for further activation, DNA adduct formation, and carcinogenesis.

abstract = {Introduction: Several states with large Hispanic populations have historically served as the source for US Hispanic cancer incidence rates, with aggregation of data across all states limited by different methodologies to identify Hispanic persons. Now with data available for more than 85{\%} of the US Hispanic population, state rates suggest regional diversity in their Hispanic cancer profiles. Method: We tested an approach of using a surrogate indicator of county residential homogeneity for Hispanic groups based on the 2000 US Census. The indicator used the counts of specific Hispanic residents compared to the total Hispanic population in the county to define counties with homogenous Hispanic populations. From these data, we aggregated counties into homogeneity categories for each Hispanic group and defined thresholds and rules for allocating Hispanic persons to a specific Hispanic group. Results: We found that it was possible to use county demographic data in many counties to meaningfully attribute a specific Hispanic ethnicity to incident cancer cases based on homogeneity thresholds. Cancer rates for the US Hispanic population describe a profile of high rates of cancers of the liver, gallbladder, cervix (in female), stomach, and lower rates of the cancers of the lung, female breast, and prostate compared with the non-Hispanic white population. In general, rates among US Mexicans are lower than the US Hispanic rates, while rates for Puerto Ricans and Cubans are higher than the US Hispanic rates. Additional variations among the three Hispanic groups were also evident. Conclusion: The approach yielded reasonable and useful information to explore etiologic differences among the populations, as well as to develop relevant cancer control interventions. However, direct identification of specific Hispanic ethnicity in medical records and annual Census estimates of these populations would be preferable if they ever became available. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The lower breast cancer incidence in minority women and the higher breast cancer mortality in African American women than in white women are largely unexplained. The influence of breast cancer risk factors on these differences has received little attention.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Racial/ethnic differences in breast cancer incidence and outcome were examined in 156,570 postmenopausal women participating in the Women's Health Initiative. Detailed information on breast cancer risk factors including mammography was collected, and participants were followed prospectively for breast cancer incidence, pathological breast cancer characteristics, and breast cancer mortality. Comparisons of breast cancer incidence and mortality across racial/ethnic groups were estimated as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) from Cox proportional hazard models. Tumor characteristics were compared as odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals in logistic regression models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: After median follow-up of 6.3 years, 3938 breast cancers were diagnosed. Age-adjusted incidences for all minority groups (i.e., African American, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Asian/Pacific Islander) were lower than for white women, but adjustment for breast cancer risk factors accounted for the differences for all but African Americans (HR = 0.75, 95{\%} CI = 0.61 to 0.92) corresponding to 29 cases and 44 cases per 10,000 person years for African American and white women, respectively. Breast cancers in African American women had unfavorable characteristics; 32{\%} of those in African Americans but only 10{\%} in whites were both high grade and estrogen receptor negative (adjusted OR = 4.70, 95{\%} CI = 3.12 to 7.09). Moreover, after adjustment for prognostic factors, African American women had higher mortality after breast cancer than white women (HR = 1.79, 95{\%} CI = 1.05 to 3.05) corresponding to nine and six deaths per 10 000 person-years from diagnosis in African American and white women, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Differences in breast cancer incidence rates between most racial/ethnic groups were largely explained by risk factor distribution except in African Americans. However, breast cancers in African American women more commonly had characteristics of poor prognosis, which may contribute to their increased mortality after diagnosis.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown inconsistent associations between red and processed meat intake and breast cancer risk. N-nitroso compounds and heme iron have been hypothesized as contributing factors. We followed 193,742 postmenopausal women in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study and identified 9,305 incident breast cancers (1995-2006). Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire at baseline. We adjusted daily intakes of meat, nitrite, and heme iron for energy intake using the nutrient density method. We estimated multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) by quintiles of dietary exposures for all breast cancer, by stage (in-situ, localized, regional/distant), and by estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status using Cox proportional hazards regression. Total red meat intake was positively associated with risk of regional/distant cancer (p-trend=0.02). The risk was 25{\%} higher in the highest vs. lowest intake quintile (95{\%}CI=1.03-1.52). Higher processed red meat intake (Q5 vs. Q1) was associated with 27{\%} higher risk of localized breast cancer (95{\%}CI=1.01-1.27, p-trend=0.03) and a 19{\%} higher risk of regional/distant cancer (95{\%}CI=0.98-1.44, p-trend=0.10). In addition, higher nitrite intake from processed red meat was positively associated with localized cancer (HR for Q5 vs. Q1=1.23, 95{\%}CI=1.09-1.39, p-trend{\textless}0.0001). Heme iron intake was positively associated with breast cancer risk overall and all cancer stages (p-trend=0.02-0.05). No heterogeneity was observed in risk associations by hormone receptor status. Our findings suggest that high consumption of red meat and processed meat may increase risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Added nitrite and heme iron may partly contribute to these observed associations. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The evaluation of less frequent genetic variants and their effect on complex disease pose new challenges for genomic research. To investigate whether epigenetic data can be used to inform aggregate rare-variant association methods (RVAM), we assessed whether variants more significantly associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) were preferentially located in non-coding regulatory regions, and whether enrichment was specific to colorectal tissues. METHODS Active regulatory elements (ARE) were mapped using data from 127 tissues and cell-types from NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) projects. We investigated whether CRC association p-values were more significant for common variants inside versus outside AREs, or 2) inside colorectal (CR) AREs versus AREs of other tissues and cell-types. We employed an integrative epigenomic RVAM for variants with allele frequency {\textless}1{\%}. Gene sets were defined as ARE variants within 200 kilobases of a transcription start site (TSS) using either CR ARE or ARE from non-digestive tissues. CRC-set association p-values were used to evaluate enrichment of less frequent variant associations in CR ARE versus non-digestive ARE. RESULTS ARE from 126/127 tissues and cell-types were significantly enriched for stronger CRC-variant associations. Strongest enrichment was observed for digestive tissues and immune cell types. CR-specific ARE were also enriched for stronger CRC-variant associations compared to ARE combined across non-digestive tissues (p-value = 9.6 × 10-4). Additionally, we found enrichment of stronger CRC association p-values for rare variant sets of CR ARE compared to non-digestive ARE (p-value = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS Integrative epigenomic RVAM may enable discovery of less frequent variants associated with CRC, and ARE of digestive and immune tissues are most informative. Although distance-based aggregation of less frequent variants in CR ARE surrounding TSS showed modest enrichment, future association studies would likely benefit from joint analysis of transcriptomes and epigenomes to better link regulatory variation with target genes.},

abstract = {For over a decade functional gene-to-gene interaction (epistasis) has been suspected to be a determinant in the "missing heritability" of complex traits. However, searching for epistasis on the genome-wide scale has been challenging due to the prohibitively large number of tests which result in a serious loss of statistical power as well as computational challenges. In this article, we propose a two-stage method applicable to existing case-control data sets, which aims to lessen both of these problems by pre-assessing whether a candidate pair of genetic loci is involved in epistasis before it is actually tested for interaction with respect to a complex phenotype. The pre-assessment is based on a two-locus genotype independence test performed in the sample of cases. Only the pairs of loci that exhibit non-equilibrium frequencies are analyzed via a logistic regression score test, thereby reducing the multiple testing burden. Since only the computationally simple independence tests are performed for all pairs of loci while the more demanding score tests are restricted to the most promising pairs, genome-wide association study (GWAS) for epistasis becomes feasible. By design our method provides strong control of the type I error. Its favourable power properties especially under the practically relevant misspecification of the interaction model are illustrated. Ready-to-use software is available. Using the method we analyzed Parkinson's disease in four cohorts and identified possible interactions within several SNP pairs in multiple cohorts.},

METHODS Population-based case-control study of HISP (796 cases, 919 controls) and NHW (1,525 cases, 1,596 controls) women. RESULTS 19.3{\%} of HISP women reported five or more births and had a reduced risk of breast cancer, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.70 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.50, 0.98) compared to those with one or two births. Breast cancer risk for HISP increased with older age at first birth, p trend = 0.008. Parity and age at first birth associations were specific to ER positive tumors. HISP women who had given birth within five years had higher breast cancer risk than women with 16-25 years since a birth, OR 2.62 (95{\%} CI: 1.44, 4.78); the trend with years since last birth was stronger than for NHWs, p interaction = 0.05. CONCLUSIONS Reproductive history influences on breast cancer risk among HISP were similar to associations reported for NHWs. Differences in the prevalence of reproductive risk factors would explain an estimated 6.6{\%} lower breast cancer incidence for HISP compared to NHWs.},

This study aims to describe SES disparity in cancer incidence within each of four major racial/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic white, black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander) for five major cancer sites, including female breast cancer, colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Invasive cancers of the five major sites diagnosed from 1998 to 2002 (n = 376,158) in California were included in the study. Composite area-based SES measures were used to quantify SES level and to calculate cancer incidence rates stratified by SES. Relative index of inequality (RII) was generated to measure SES gradient of cancer incidence within each racial/ethnic group.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Significant variations were detected in SES disparities across the racial/ethnic groups for all five major cancer sites. Female breast cancer and prostate cancer incidence increased with increased SES in all groups, with the trend strongest among Hispanics. Incidence of cervical cancer increased with decreased SES, with the largest gradient among non-Hispanic white women. Lung cancer incidence increased with decreased SES with the exception of Hispanic men and women, for whom SES gradient was in the opposite direction. For colorectal cancer, higher incidence was associated with lower SES in non-Hispanic whites but with higher SES in Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islander women.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Examining SES disparity stratified by race/ethnicity enhances our understanding of the complex relationships between cancer incidence, SES, and race/ethnicity.},

abstract = {Diets containing substantial amounts of red or preserved meats may increase the risk of various cancers, including colorectal cancer. This association may be due to a combination of factors such as the content of fat, protein, iron, and/or meat preparation (e.g., cooking or preserving methods). Red meat may be associated with colorectal cancer by contributing to N-nitroso compound (NOC) exposure. Humans can be exposed to NOCs by exogenous routes (from processed meats in particular) and by endogenous routes. Endogenous exposure to NOCs is dose-dependently related to the amount of red meat in the diet. Laboratory results have shown that meats cooked at high temperatures contain other potential mutagens in the form of heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). To investigate the role of these compounds, we have created separate databases for HCAs and PAHs, which we have used in conjunction with a validated meat-cooking food frequency questionnaire. The role of meat type, cooking methods, doneness levels, and meat-cooking mutagens has been examined in both case-control studies and prospective cohort studies, with mixed results. Here, we review the current epidemiologic knowledge of meat-related mutagens, and evaluate the types of studies that may be required in the future to clarify the association between meat consumption and colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association analysis has generated much discussion about how to preserve power to detect signals despite the detrimental effect of multiple testing on power. We develop a weighted multiple testing procedure that facilitates the input of prior information in the form of groupings of tests. For each group a weight is estimated from the observed test statistics within the group. Differentially weighting groups improves the power to detect signals in likely groupings. The advantage of the grouped-weighting concept, over fixed weights based on prior information, is that it often leads to an increase in power even if many of the groupings are not correlated with the signal. Being data dependent, the procedure is remarkably robust to poor choices in groupings. Power is typically improved if one (or more) of the groups clusters multiple tests with signals, yet little power is lost when the groupings are totally random. If there is no apparent signal in a group, relative to a group that appears to have several tests with signals, the former group will be down-weighted relative to the latter. If no groups show apparent signals, then the weights will be approximately equal. The only restriction on the procedure is that the number of groups be small, relative to the total number of tests performed.},

abstract = {Objectives. We examined the combined influence of race/ethnicity and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) on short-term survival among women with uniform access to health care and treatment. Methods. Using electronic medical records data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California linked to data from the California Cancer Registry, we included 6262 women newly diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. We analyzed survival using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with follow-up through 2010. Results. After consideration of tumor stage, subtype, comorbidity, and type of treatment received, non-Hispanic White women living in low-SES neighborhoods (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28; 95{\%} confidence interval [Cl] = 1.07, 1.52) and African Americans regardless of neighborhood SES (high SES: HR = 1.44; 95{\%} Cl = 1.01, 2.07; low SES: HR = 1.88; 95{\%} Cl=1.42, 2.50) had worse overall survival than did non-Hispanic White women living in high-SES neighborhoods. Results were similar for breast cancer-specific survival, except that African Americans and non-Hispanic Whites living in high-SES neighborhoods had similar survival. Conclusions. Strategies to address the underlying factors that may influence treatment intensity and adherence, such as comorbidities and logistical barriers, should be targeted at low-SES non-Hispanic White and all African American patients.

The prevalence of the different intrinsic subtypes varies between population groups.

abstract = {Inflammation, hormones and energy-related factors have been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) and it has been proposed that convergence and interactions of these factors importantly influence CRC risk. We have previously hypothesized that genetic variation in the CHIEF (convergence of hormones, inflammation and energy-related factors) pathway would influence risk of CRC. In this paper, we utilize an Adaptive Rank Truncation Product (ARTP) statistical method to determine the overall pathway significance and then use that method to identify the key elements within the pathway associated with disease risk. Data from two population-based case-control studies of colon (n = 1555 cases and 1956 controls) and rectal (n = 754 cases and 959 controls) cancer were used. We use ARTP to estimate pathway and gene significance and polygenic scores based on ARTP findings to further estimate the risk associated with the pathway. Associations were further assessed based on tumor molecular phenotype. The CHIEF pathway was statistically significant for colon cancer (P(ARTP)= 0.03) with the most significant interferons (P(ARTP) = 0.0253), JAK/STAT/SOCS (P(ARTP) = 0.0111), telomere (P(ARTP) = 0.0399) and transforming growth factor $\beta$ (P(ARTP) = 0.0043) being the most significant subpathways for colon cancer. For rectal cancer, interleukins (P(ARTP) = 0.0235) and selenoproteins (P ARTP = 0.0047) were statistically significant although the pathway overall was of borderline significance (P(ARTP) = 0.06). Interleukins (P(ARTP) = 0.0456) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (P(ARTP) = 0.0392) subpathways were uniquely significant for CpG island methylator phenotype-positive colon tumors. Increasing number of at-risk alleles was significantly associated with both colon [odds ratio (OR) = 6.21, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 4.72, 8.16] and rectal (OR = 7.82, 95{\%} CI: 5.26, 11.62) cancer. We conclude that elements of the CHIEF pathway are important for CRC risk.},

abstract = {Although whole-genome association studies using tagSNPs are a powerful approach for detecting common variants, they are underpowered for detecting associations with rare variants. Recent studies have demonstrated that common diseases can be due to functional variants with a wide spectrum of allele frequencies, ranging from rare to common. An effective way to identify rare variants is through direct sequencing. The development of cost-effective sequencing technologies enables association studies to use sequence data from candidate genes and, in the future, from the entire genome. Although methods used for analysis of common variants are applicable to sequence data, their performance might not be optimal. In this study, it is shown that the collapsing method, which involves collapsing genotypes across variants and applying a univariate test, is powerful for analyzing rare variants, whereas multivariate analysis is robust against inclusion of noncausal variants. Both methods are superior to analyzing each variant individually with univariate tests. In order to unify the advantages of both collapsing and multiple-marker tests, we developed the Combined Multivariate and Collapsing (CMC) method and demonstrated that the CMC method is both powerful and robust. The CMC method can be applied to either candidate-gene or whole-genome sequence data.},

ORs showed no significant heterogeneity across strata of age at diagnosis and sex. No convincing relation with red meat intake emerged for cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx and esophagus, liver, gallbladder, larynx, kidney, thyroid, prostate, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and multiple myeloma. For none of the neoplasms considered was there a significant inverse relationship with red meat intake. Thus, reducing red meat intake might lower the risk for several common neoplasms.},

abstract = {Population stratification has the potential to affect the results of genetic marker studies. Estimating individual ancestry provides a continuous measure to assess population structure in case-control studies of complex disease, instead of using self-reported racial groups. We estimate individual ancestry using the Federal Bureau of Investigation CODIS Core short tandem repeat set of 13 loci using two different analysis methods in a case-control study of early-onset lung cancer. Individual ancestry proportions were estimated for "European" and "West African" groups using published allele frequencies. The majority of Caucasian, non-Hispanics had {\textgreater}50{\%} European ancestry, whereas the majority of African Americans had {\textless}20{\%} European ancestry, regardless of ancestry estimation method, although significant overlap by self-reported race and ancestry also existed. When we further investigated the effect of ancestry and self-reported race on the frequency of a lung cancer risk genotype, we found that the frequency of the GSTM1 null genotype varies by individual European ancestry and case-control status within self-reported race (particularly for African Americans). Genetic risk models showed that adjusting for individual European ancestry provided a better fit to the data compared with the model with no group adjustment or adjustment for self-reported race. This study suggests that significant population substructure differences exist that self-reported race alone does not capture and that individual ancestry may be confounded with disease status and/or a candidate gene risk genotype.},

METHODS Using linked SEER-Medicare data, a cohort was created that included incident cases of breast, endometrial, lung, prostate, or rectal cancer from 1991 to 1996 in persons 65 years and older. For each of these cases, use of radiation therapy as an initial course of treatment reported from the SEER data was compared with use of radiation therapy in the months following diagnosis, as determined from the Medicare claims. RESULTS Overall, there was a high agreement between SEER and Medicare sources for use of radiation therapy. Agreement was 88{\%} for lung cancer, 93{\%} for prostate cancer, 94{\%} for rectal and breast cancers, and 95{\%} for endometrial cancer. Within the Medicare files, radiation claims were found in MedPAR Physician Supplier Part B and Outpatient files. CONCLUSIONS There is a high level of agreement between SEER and Medicare reporting of radiation treatments after a cancer diagnosis, suggesting that either source can be used to assess radiation-related treatment patterns. However, for the most complete ascertainment of radiation use, both SEER and Medicare sources should be used.},

abstract = {Identification of gene-environment interaction (G × E) is important in understanding the etiology of complex diseases. However, partially due to the lack of power, there have been very few replicated G × E findings compared to the success in marginal association studies. The existing G × E testing methods mainly focus on improving the power for individual markers. In this paper, we took a different strategy and proposed a set-based gene-environment interaction test (SBERIA), which can improve the power by reducing the multiple testing burdens and aggregating signals within a set. The major challenge of the signal aggregation within a set is how to tell signals from noise and how to determine the direction of the signals. SBERIA takes advantage of the established correlation screening for G × E to guide the aggregation of genotypes within a marker set. The correlation screening has been shown to be an efficient way of selecting potential G × E candidate SNPs in case-control studies for complex diseases. Importantly, the correlation screening in case-control combined samples is independent of the interaction test. With this desirable feature, SBERIA maintains the correct type I error level and can be easily implemented in a regular logistic regression setting. We showed that SBERIA had higher power than benchmark methods in various simulation scenarios, both for common and rare variants. We also applied SBERIA to real genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data of 10,729 colorectal cancer cases and 13,328 controls and found evidence of interaction between the set of known colorectal cancer susceptibility loci and smoking.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the last few years, genome-wide association (GWA) studies became a tool of choice for the identification of loci associated with complex traits. Currently, imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) data are frequently used in GWA analyzes. Correct analysis of imputed data calls for the implementation of specific methods which take genotype imputation uncertainty into account.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We developed the ProbABEL software package for the analysis of genome-wide imputed SNP data and quantitative, binary, and time-till-event outcomes under linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards models, respectively. For quantitative traits, the package also implements a fast two-step mixed model-based score test for association in samples with differential relationships, facilitating analysis in family-based studies, studies performed in human genetically isolated populations and outbred animal populations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: ProbABEL package provides fast efficient way to analyze imputed data in genome-wide context and will facilitate future identification of complex trait loci.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Chronic inflammation is believed to contribute to the development and progression of breast cancer. Systemic C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) are measures of low-grade chronic inflammation and potential predictors of cancer survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS We evaluated the relationship between circulating markers of inflammation and breast cancer survival using data from the Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle (HEAL) Study (a multiethnic prospective cohort study of women diagnosed with stage 0 to IIIA breast cancer). Circulating concentrations of CRP and SAA were measured approximately 31 months after diagnosis and tested for associations with disease-free survival (approximately 4.1 years of follow-up) and overall survival (approximately 6.9 years of follow-up) in 734 disease-free breast cancer survivors. Cox proportional hazards models were used with adjustment for potential confounding factors to generate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95{\%} CIs. Results Elevated SAA and CRP were associated with reduced overall survival, regardless of adjustment for age, tumor stage, race, and body mass index (SAA P trend {\textless} .0001; CRP P trend = .002). The HRs for SAA and CRP tertiles suggested a threshold effect on survival, rather than a dose-response relationship (highest v lowest tertile: SAA HR = 3.15; 95{\%} CI, 1.73 to 5.65; CRP HR = 2.27; 95{\%} CI, 1.27 to 4.08). Associations were similar and still significant after adjusting for self-reported history of cardiovascular events and censoring cardiovascular disease deaths. Elevated CRP and SAA were also associated with reduced disease-free survival, although these associations were of borderline significance (SAA P trend = .04; CRP P trend = .07). CONCLUSION Circulating SAA and CRP may be important prognostic markers for long-term survival in breast cancer patients, independent of race, tumor stage, and body mass index.},

We took a two-stage approach to conduct genome-wide association studies for lung, ovary, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer from the GAME-ON/GECCO Network (61,851 cases, 61,820 controls) to identify pleiotropic loci. Findings were replicated in independent association studies (55,789 cases, 330,490 controls). We identified a novel pleiotropic association at 1q22 involving breast and lung squamous cell carcinoma, with eQTL analysis showing an association with ADAM15/THBS3 gene expression in lung. We also identified a known breast cancer locus CASP8/ALS2CR12 associated with prostate cancer, a known cancer locus at CDKN2B-AS1 with different variants associated with lung adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer, and confirmed the associations of a breast BRCA2 locus with lung and serous ovarian cancer.

Meat intake may increase cancer risk as HCAs, PAHs, and N-nitroso compounds are carcinogenic in animal models. We investigated meat, processed meat, HCAs, and the PAH benzo(a)pyrene and the risk of colorectal adenoma in 3,696 left-sided (descending and sigmoid colon and rectum) adenoma cases and 34,817 endoscopy-negative controls. Dietary intake was assessed using a 137-item food frequency questionnaire, with additional questions on meats and meat cooking practices. The questionnaire was linked to a previously developed database to determine exposure to HCAs and PAHs. Intake of red meat, with known doneness/cooking methods, was associated with an increased risk of adenoma in the descending and sigmoid colon [odds ratio (OR), 1.26; 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI), 1.05-1.50 comparing extreme quintiles of intake] but not rectal adenoma. Well-done red meat was associated with increased risk of colorectal adenoma (OR, 1.21; 95{\%} CI, 1.06-1.37). Increased risks for adenoma of the descending colon and sigmoid colon were observed for the two HCAs: 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5]quinoxaline and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5]pyridine (OR, 1.18; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-1.38 and OR, 1.17, 95{\%} CI, 1.01-1.35, respectively) as well as benzo(a)pyrene (OR, 1.18; 95{\%} CI, 1.02-1.35). Greater intake of bacon and sausage was associated with increased colorectal adenoma risk (OR, 1.14; 95{\%} CI, 1.00-1.30); however, total intake of processed meat was not (OR, 1.04; 95{\%} CI, 0.90-1.19).

Logistic regression models were used in case-case analyses to estimate associations between epidemiological risk factors and tumor subtypes, and case-control analyses to estimate associations between epidemiological risk factors and the risk of developing specific tumor subtypes in 12 population-based studies. All statistical tests were two-sided.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In case-case analyses, of the epidemiological risk factors examined, early age at menarche (≤12 years) was less frequent in case patients with PR(-) than PR(+) tumors (P = .001). Nulliparity (P = 3 × 10(-6)) and increasing age at first birth (P = 2 × 10(-9)) were less frequent in ER(-) than in ER(+) tumors. Obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) in younger women (≤50 years) was more frequent in ER(-)/PR(-) than in ER(+)/PR(+) tumors (P = 1 × 10(-7)), whereas obesity in older women ({\textgreater}50 years) was less frequent in PR(-) than in PR(+) tumors (P = 6 × 10(-4)). The triple-negative (ER(-)/PR(-)/HER2(-)) or core basal phenotype (CBP; triple-negative and cytokeratins [CK]5/6(+) and/or epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR](+)) accounted for much of the heterogeneity in parity-related variables and BMI in younger women. Case-control analyses showed that nulliparity, increasing age at first birth, and obesity in younger women showed the expected associations with the risk of ER(+) or PR(+) tumors but not triple-negative (nulliparity vs parity, odds ratio [OR] = 0.94, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 0.75 to 1.19, P = .61; 5-year increase in age at first full-term birth, OR = 0.95, 95{\%} CI = 0.86 to 1.05, P = .34; obesity in younger women, OR = 1.36, 95{\%} CI = 0.95 to 1.94, P = .09) or CBP tumors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study shows that reproductive factors and BMI are most clearly associated with hormone receptor-positive tumors and suggest that triple-negative or CBP tumors may have distinct etiology.},

abstract = {Research shows that married cancer patients have lower mortality than unmarried patients but few data exist for breast cancer. We assessed total mortality associated with marital status, with attention to differences by race/ethnicity, tumor subtype, and neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES). We included, from the population-based California Cancer Registry, women ages 18 and older with invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 2005 and 2012 with follow-up through December 2013. We estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) for total mortality by nSES, race/ethnicity, and tumor subtype. Among 145,564 breast cancer cases, 42.7{\%} were unmarried at the time of diagnosis. In multivariable-adjusted models, the MRR (95{\%} CI) for unmarried compared to married women was 1.28 (1.24-1.32) for total mortality. Significant interactions were observed by race/ethnicity (P{\textless}0.001), tumor subtype (P{\textless}0.001), and nSES (P = 0.009). Higher MRRs were observed for non-Hispanic whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders than for blacks or Hispanics, and for HR+/HER2+ tumors than other subtypes. Assessment of interactive effect between marital status and nSES showed that unmarried women living in low SES neighborhoods had a higher risk of dying compared with married women in high SES neighborhoods (MRR = 1.60; 95{\%} CI: 1.53-1.67). Unmarried breast cancer patients have higher total mortality than married patients; the association varies by race/ethnicity, tumor subtype, and nSES. Unmarried status should be further evaluated as a breast cancer prognostic factor. Identification of underlying causes of the marital status associations is needed to design interventions that could improve survival for unmarried breast cancer patients.},

abstract = {Estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) may be expressed in thyroid tumors, but their prognostic role is controversial. We investigated whether ER and AR expressions could confer a more aggressive phenotype to thyroid tumors. We enrolled 91 patients (13 males and 78 females, mean age 49.3±14.8 years) bearing small (T1 in the 2006 TNM system) differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC). Thirty-eight tumors were incidental histological findings. Using immunohistochemistry, we evaluated ER$\alpha$, ER$\beta$, and AR expressions in tumors and in its correspondent extra-tumor parenchyma. In tumors, 13 (16.7{\%}) women and one (7.7{\%}) man expressed ER$\alpha$; 42 (53.8{\%}) women and six (46{\%}) men expressed ER$\beta$; and 16 (20.5{\%}) women and three (23.1{\%}) men expressed AR. In normal thyroid parenchymas, ER$\beta$ was expressed in 52 (66.7{\%}) women and nine (69.2{\%}) men, ER$\alpha$ in three (3.8{\%}) women, and AR in 13 (16.7{\%}) women. Compared with normal thyroid parenchyma, tumors gained ER$\alpha$ and lost ER$\beta$ expressions. Incidental cancers were more commonly ER$\alpha$(-) than ER$\alpha$(+) (47.7 vs 14.3{\%}, P=0.037). Postsurgical serum thyroglobulin was higher in ER$\alpha$(+) tumors than in the ER$\alpha$(-) tumors (P=0.04). ER$\beta$(-) tumors showed vascular invasion more frequently than the ER$\beta$(+) tumors (26.2 vs 4.1{\%}, P=0.005). AR(+) tumors showed capsular invasion more frequently than the AR(-) tumors (77.8 vs 46.6{\%}, P=0.014). In conclusion, ER$\alpha$ positivity, ER$\beta$ negativity, and AR expressions are associated with a more aggressive phenotype of small T1-DTC. ER and AR expressions may represent an additional criterion in deciding whether to perform radioiodine ablation in these tumors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: N-acetyltransferases (NAT) 1 and 2 are polymorphic enzymes catalyzing the metabolic activation of heterocyclic amines. We investigated the modifying effects of NAT1 and NAT2 polymorphisms on the association of meat consumption, heterocyclic amine intake, and smoking with colorectal cancer risk. METHOD: In the Multiethnic Cohort study, participants completed a smoking history and a food-frequency questionnaire at recruitment and a cooked meat module 5 years later to estimate heterocyclic amine intake (2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline). Blood samples were collected from incident cases and age-, sex-, ethnicity-, frequency-matched controls to determine genotypes. For analysis of meat intake and smoking, data were available for 1,009 cases and 1,522 controls; for heterocyclic amine intake analyses, 398 cases and 1,444 controls were available. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios. RESULTS: Smoking was associated with an increased colorectal cancer risk (odds ratio, 1.51; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.17-1.95) for {\textgreater} or =30 pack-years compared with never smokers (P trend = 0.0004). The association was stronger with presence of the "rapid" compared with the "slow/intermediate" NAT2 genotype (P interaction = 0.003). No significant associations were observed for intakes of red meat, processed meat, and heterocyclic amine, or meat doneness preference, but a dietary pattern high in meat showed a weak positive interaction with the NAT2 genotype (P interaction = 0.05). CONCLUSION: The enhanced association between smoking and colorectal cancer risk in subjects with the NAT2 rapid genotype supports a role for NAT2 and tobacco smoke heterocyclic amines in the etiology of colorectal cancer. This study only provides weak support for a similar association with meat heterocyclic amines.},

abstract = {N-Acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1), encoded by the polymorphic NAT1 gene, has been shown to be one of the major enzymes in human breast tissue that activates aromatic and heterocyclic amines. Humans are mainly exposed to these carcinogens through cigarette smoking and consumption of well- done meat. To test the hypothesis that variations in the NAT1 gene are related to breast cancer risk, particularly among women who smoke or consume high levels of well-done meat, a nested case-control study was conducted in a prospective cohort study of 41,837 postmenopausal Iowa women. Information on cigarette smoking and other breast cancer risk factors was obtained at the baseline survey conducted in 1986. DNA samples and information on the consumption of well-done meat were obtained, in the case-control study, from breast cancer cases diagnosed from 1992 to 1994 and a random sample of cancer-free cohort members. Genomic DNA samples obtained from 154 cases and 330 controls were assayed for 11 NAT1 alleles (NAT1*3, *4, *5, *10, *11, *14, *15, *16, *17, *19, and *22). The NAT1*4 allele was the predominant allele observed in this study population, accounting for 73.2{\%} (72.4{\%} in cases versus 73.8{\%} in controls) of the total alleles analyzed. Compared to controls, breast cancer cases had a slightly higher frequency of the NAT1*10 allele (18.8{\%} in cases versus 17.3{\%} in controls) and a substantially higher frequency of the NAT1*11 allele (3.6{\%} versus 1.2{\%}). In multivariate analyses, we found a 30{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.8-1.9] elevated risk of breast cancer associated with the NAT1*10 allele and a nearly 4-fold (95{\%} CI = 1.5-10.5) elevated risk associated with the NAT1*11 allele. The positive association of breast cancer with the NAT1*11 allele was more evident among smokers [odds ratio (OR) = 13.2, 95{\%} CI = 1.5-116.0] and those who consumed a high level of red meat (OR = 6.1, 95{\%} CI = 1.1-33.2) or consistently consumed their red meat well done (OR = 5.6, 95{\%} CI = 0.5-62.7). The association of the NAT1*10 allele with breast cancer was mainly confined to former smokers (OR = 3.3, 95{\%} CI = 1.2-9.5). These findings are consistent with a role for the NAT1 gene in the etiology of human breast cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND National cancer incidence trends are presented for eight Asian American groups: Asian Indians/Pakistanis, Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, Kampucheans, Koreans, Laotians, and Vietnamese. METHODS Cancer incidence data from 1990 through 2008 were obtained from 13 Surveillance, Epidemiology, End Results (SEER) registries. Incidence rates from 1990 through 2008 and average percentage change were computed using SEER*Stat and Joinpoint software. The annual percentage change (APC) in incidence rates was estimated with 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CIs) calculated for both the rate and APC estimates. Rates for non-Hispanic whites are presented for comparison. RESULTS Prostate cancer was the most common malignancy among most groups, followed by lung, colorectal, liver, and stomach cancers. Breast cancer was generally the most common cancer in women, followed by colorectal and lung cancers; liver, cervix, thyroid, and stomach cancers also ranked highly. Among men, increasing trends were observed for prostate (Asian Indians and Pakistanis: APC 1990-2003 = 2.2, 95{\%} CI = 0.3 to 4.1; Filipinos: APC 1990-1994 = 19.0, 95{\%} CI = 4.5 to 35.4; Koreans: APC 1990-2008 = 2.9, 95{\%} CI = 1.8 to 4.0), colorectal (Koreans: APC 1990-2008 = 2.2, 95{\%} CI = 0.9 to 3.5), and liver cancers (Filipinos: APC 1990-2008 = 1.6, 95{\%} CI = 0.4 to 2.7; Koreans: APC 1990-2006 = 2.1, 95{\%} CI = 0.4 to 3.7; Vietnamese: APC 1990-2008 = 1.6, 95{\%} CI = 0.3 to 2.8), whereas lung and stomach cancers generally remained stable or decreased. Among women, increases were observed for uterine cancer (Asian Indians: APC 1990-2008 = 3.0, 95{\%} CI = 0.3 to 5.8; Chinese: APC 2004-2008 = 7.0, 95{\%} CI = 1.4 to 12.9; Filipina: APC 1990-2008 = 3.0, 95{\%} CI = 2.4 to 3.7; Japanese: APC 1990-2008 = 1.1, 95{\%} CI = 0.1 to 2.0), colorectal cancer (Koreans: APC 1990-2008 = 2.8, 95{\%} CI = 1.7 to 3.9; Laotians: APC: 1990-2008 = 5.9, 95{\%} CI = 4.0 to 7.7), lung cancer (Filipinas: APC 1990-2008 = 2.1, 95{\%} CI = 1.4 to 2.8; Koreans: APC 1990-2008 = 2.1, 95{\%} CI = 0.6 to 3.6), thyroid cancer (Filipinas: APC 1990-2008 = 2.5, 95{\%} CI = 1.7 to 3.3), and breast cancer in most groups (APC 1990-2008 from 1.2 among Vietnamese and Chinese to 4.7 among Koreans). Decreases were observed for stomach (Chinese and Japanese), colorectal (Chinese), and cervical cancers (Laotians and Vietnamese). CONCLUSIONS These data fill a critical knowledge gap concerning the cancer experience of Asian American groups and highlight where increased preventive, screening, and surveillance efforts are needed-in particular, lung cancer among Filipina and Korean women and Asian Indian/Pakistani men, breast cancer among all women, and liver cancer among Vietnamese, Laotian, and Kampuchean women and Filipino, Kampuchean, and Vietnamese men.},

@article{Russo2006,
abstract = {Estrogens are considered to play a major role in promoting the proliferation of both the normal and the neoplastic breast epithelium. Their role as breast carcinogens has long been suspected and recently confirmed by epidemiological studies. Three major mechanisms are postulated to be involved in their carcinogenic effects: stimulation of cellular proliferation through their receptor-mediated hormonal activity, direct genotoxic effects by increasing mutation rates through a cytochrome P450-mediated metabolic activation, and induction of aneuploidy. Recently it has been fully demonstrated that estrogens are carcinogenic in the human breast by testing in an experimental system the natural estrogen 17$\beta$-estradiol (E2) by itself or its metabolites 2-hydroxy, 4-hydroxy, and 16-a-hydroxy-estradiol (2-OH-E2, 4-OH-E2, and 16-$\alpha$-OH E2), respectively, by inducing neoplastic transformation of human breast epithelial cells (HBEC) MCF-10F in vitro to a degree at least similar to that induced by the chemical carcinogen benz(a)pyrene (BP). Neither Tamoxyfen (TAM) nor ICI-182,780 abrogated the transforming efficiency of estrogen or its metabolites. The E2induced expression of anchorage independent growth, loss of ductulogenesis in collagen, invasiveness in Matrigel, is associated with the loss of 9p11-13 and only invasive cells that exhibited a 4p15.3-16 deletion were tumorigenic. Tumors were poorly differentiated ER-$\alpha$ and progesterone receptor negative adenocarcinomas that expressed keratins, EMA and E-cadherin. The E2induced tumors and tumor-derived cell lines exhibited loss of chromosome 4, deletions in chromosomes 3p12.3-13, 8p11.1-21, 9p21-qter, and 18q, and gains in 1p, and 5q15-qter. The induction of complete transformation of the human breast epithelial cell MCF-10F in vitro confirms the carcinogenicity of E2, supporting the concept that this hormone could act as an initiator of breast cancer in women. This model provides a unique system for understanding the genomic changes that intervene for leading normal cells to tumorigenesis and for testing the functional role of specific genomic events taking place during neoplastic transformation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates vary worldwide. In the United States, prostate cancer is the most common malignancy affecting men and is the second-leading cause of cancer death. Risk of developing prostate cancer is associated with advancing age, African American ethnicity, and a positive family history, and may be influenced by diet and other factors. The incidence of prostate cancer increased sharply after the introduction of widespread screening for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), although rates have now returned to levels seen before that time. PSA screening has been associated with a shift toward diagnosis of earlier-stage disease, but this has not been accompanied by a shift toward a lower histologic grade. Although overall prostate cancer mortality rates decreased during the 1990s, it was largely because of reductions in deaths among men diagnosed with distant disease. In contrast, mortality rates for men diagnosed with localized or regional disease increased gradually during most of the 1990s before decreasing slightly among white men and reaching plateaus among African Americans. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.},

We also found that GSTP1 Ile105Val might modify the association between intake of poultry cooked with high temperature methods and CRC risk (p = 0.0035), a finding that was stronger among rectal cancer cases. Our results support a role for heterocyclic amines that form in red meat as a potential explanation for the observed association between diets high in red meat and CRC.

abstract = {In epidemiological research, the causal effect of a modifiable phenotype or exposure on a disease is often of public health interest. Randomized controlled trials to investigate this effect are not always possible and inferences based on observational data can be confounded. However, if we know of a gene closely linked to the phenotype without direct effect on the disease, it can often be reasonably assumed that the gene is not itself associated with any confounding factors — a phenomenon called Mendelian randomization. These properties define an instrumental variable and allow estimation of the causal effect, despite the confounding, under certain model restrictions. In this paper, we present a formal framework for causal inference based on Mendelian randomization and suggest using directed acyclic graphs to check model assumptions by visual inspection. This framework allows us to address limitations of the Mendelian randomization technique that have often been overlooked in the medical literature.},

abstract = {With increasing frequency, epidemiologic studies are addressing hypotheses regarding gene-environment interaction. In many well-studied candidate genes and for standard dietary and behavioral epidemiologic exposures, there is often substantial prior information available that may be used to analyze current data as well as for designing a new study. In this article, first, we propose a proper full Bayesian approach for analyzing studies of gene-environment interaction. The Bayesian approach provides a natural way to incorporate uncertainties around the assumption of gene-environment independence, often used in such an analysis. We then consider Bayesian sample size determination criteria for both estimation and hypothesis testing regarding the multiplicative gene-environment interaction parameter. We illustrate our proposed methods using data from a large ongoing case-control study of colorectal cancer investigating the interaction of N-acetyl transferase type 2 (NAT2) with smoking and red meat consumption. We use the existing data to elicit a design prior and show how to use this information in allocating cases and controls in planning a future study that investigates the same interaction parameters. The Bayesian design and analysis strategies are compared with their corresponding frequentist counterparts.},

abstract = {Mammary tissue experiences the highest rate of proliferation during adolescence representing a period of heightened susceptibility. Few prospective studies have examined adolescent diet and breast cancer, and none have examined dietary patterns. Thus, we examined the association between adolescent dietary patterns and a diet quality index, the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), and breast cancer in the Nurses' Health Study II among those who completed a 124-item food frequency questionnaire about their high-school diet (HS-FFQ). Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI). Among 45204 women who completed the HS-FFQ, 863 cases of premenopausal breast cancer and 614 cases of postmenopausal cancer were diagnosed. A marginal inverse association was observed between the 'prudent' dietary pattern, characterized by high intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, fish and poultry, and premenopausal breast cancer. Women in fifth quintile had a multivariable adjusted HR (95{\%} CI) of 0.84 (0.67-1.04) for premenopausal breast cancer (Ptrend= 0.07) compared with the first quintile. Scoring higher on the AHEI was borderline significantly associated with premenopausal breast cancer with a HR of 0.81 (0.64-1.01) for the fifth quintile (Ptrend= 0.08), and this association appeared to be stronger for estrogen receptor-negative/progesterone receptor-negative tumors. No association was observed between the 'Western' pattern or the 'fast-food' pattern. Results were similar for each of these patterns when both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer were considered together. An overall healthy diet during adolescence, similar to the prudent dietary pattern or adherence to the AHEI, may contribute to reducing the risk of breast cancer.},

abstract = {Recent publications have reported that common variants on 8q24 are associated with both prostate and colorectal cancers (CRC). In addition, one of these studies (the ARCTIC study) initially observed an association with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on 9p24 that was not confirmed in some of their validation data sets. In the research described here, we conducted a case-unaffected sibling analysis using population- and clinic-based discordant sibships (N = 1,567 sibships) from the Colon Cancer Family Registry (Colon CFR) to investigate the associations between common variants at 9p24 and 8q24 and risk of CRC. We also evaluated whether these associations differed by age, family history, and tumor characteristics, including microsatellite instability and tumor site. Associations were estimated using conditional logistic regression, treating sibship as the matching factor. Analyses were adjusted for age and sex, and stratified by ascertainment source (population versus clinic). We observed an association between a SNP on 9p24 (rs719725) and risk of CRC in the population-based series (AA versus CC: odds ratios, 1.46; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.06-2.02; AC versus CC: odds ratios, 1.50; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.14-1.98; P = 0.011 on 2 df). In the population-based series, we also detected statistically significant associations between two SNPs on 8q24, rs10505477 and rs6983267, and risk of CRC (P = 0.005 and P = 0.002, respectively). There was no evidence of statistically significant heterogeneity by age at diagnosis, family history of CRC, microsatellite instability, or tumor site at either locus and no evidence of interaction between SNPs on 8q24 and 9p24. These data suggest that common variants may play important roles in the risk of CRC.},

abstract = {There is current interest in fish consumption and marine omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids and breast cancer risk. Some in vitro and animal studies have suggested an inhibitory effect of marine n-3 fatty acids on breast cancer growth, but the results from epidemiological studies that have examined the association between fish consumption and breast cancer risk in humans are inconsistent. We examined fish consumption and breast cancer risk in 310,671 women aged between 25 and 70 yr at recruitment into the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). The participants completed a dietary questionnaire between 1992-98 and were followed up for incidence of breast cancer for a median of 6.4 yr. Hazard ratio for breast cancer by intake of total and lean and fatty fish were estimated, stratified by study centre and adjusted for established breast cancer risk factors. During follow-up, 4,776 invasive incident breast cancers were reported. No significant associations between intake of total fish and breast cancer risk were observed, hazard ratio (HR) 1.01 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 0.99-1.02; p = 0.28 per 10 g fish/day). When examining lean and fatty fish separately, we found a positive significant association only in the highest quintile for fatty fish (HR 1.13, 95{\%} CI 1.01-1.26), but test for trend was not significant (p = 0.10). No associations with breast cancer risk were observed when the study participants were subdivided by menopausal status. Although the period of follow-up is relatively short, the results provide no evidence for an association between fish intake and breast cancer risk.},

abstract = {Background Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men and has high survivorship, yet little is known about the long-term risk of urinary adverse events (UAEs) after treatment. Objective To compare the long-term UAE incidence across treatment and control groups. Design, setting, and participants Using a matched-cohort design, we identified elderly men treated with external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT; n = 44 318), brachytherapy (BT; n = 14 259), EBRT+BT (n = 11 835), radical prostatectomy (RP; n = 26 970), RP+EBRT (n = 1557), or cryotherapy (n = 2115) for non-metastatic prostate cancer and 144 816 non-cancer control individuals from the population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked data from 1992-2007 with follow-up through 2009. Outcome measures and statistical analysis The incidence of treated UAEs and time from cancer treatment to first UAE were analyzed in terms of propensity-weighted survival. Results Median follow-up was 4.14 yr. At 10 yr, all treatment groups experienced higher propensity-weighted cumulative UAE incidence than the control group (16.1{\%}; hazard risk [HR] 1.0), with the highest incidence for RP+EBRT (37.8{\%}; HR 3.19, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 2.79-3.66), followed by BT+EBRT (28.4{\%}; HR 1.97, CI 1.85-2.10), RP (26.6{\%}; HR 2.44, CI 2.34-2.55), cryotherapy (23.4{\%}; HR 1.56, CI 1.30-1.87), BT (19.8{\%}; HR 1.43, CI 1.33-1.53), and EBRT (19.7{\%}; HR 1.11, CI 1.07-1.16). Bladder outlet obstruction was the most common event. Conclusions Men undergoing RP, RP+EBRT, and BT+EBRT experienced the highest UAE risk at 10 yr, although UAEs accrued differently over extended follow-up. The significant background UAE rate among non-cancer control individuals yields a risk attributable to prostate cancer treatment that is 17{\%} lower than prior estimates. Patient summary We show that treatment for prostate cancer, especially combinations of two treatments such as radiation and surgery, carries a significant risk of urinary adverse events such as urethral stricture. This risk increases with time since treatment, emphasizing that treatments have long-term effects.},

abstract = {Dietary factors, including meat, fruits, vegetables and fiber, are associated with colorectal cancer; however, there is limited information as to whether these dietary factors interact with genetic variants to modify risk of colorectal cancer. We tested interactions between these dietary factors and approximately 2.7 million genetic variants for colorectal cancer risk among 9,287 cases and 9,117 controls from ten studies. We used logistic regression to investigate multiplicative gene-diet interactions, as well as our recently developed Cocktail method that involves a screening step based on marginal associations and gene-diet correlations and a testing step for multiplicative interactions, while correcting for multiple testing using weighted hypothesis testing. Per quartile increment in the intake of red and processed meat were associated with statistically significant increased risks of colorectal cancer and vegetable, fruit and fiber intake with lower risks. From the case-control analysis, we detected a significant interaction between rs4143094 (10p14/near GATA3) and processed meat consumption (OR = 1.17; p = 8.7E-09), which was consistently observed across studies (p heterogeneity = 0.78). The risk of colorectal cancer associated with processed meat was increased among individuals with the rs4143094-TG and -TT genotypes (OR = 1.20 and OR = 1.39, respectively) and null among those with the GG genotype (OR = 1.03). Our results identify a novel gene-diet interaction with processed meat for colorectal cancer, highlighting that diet may modify the effect of genetic variants on disease risk, which may have important implications for prevention.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Risk of cancer is determined by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Although the study of gene-environment interactions (G×E) has been an active area of research, little is reported about the known findings in the literature. METHODS To examine the state of the science in G×E research in cancer, we performed a systematic review of published literature using gene-environment or pharmacogenomic flags from two curated databases of genetic association studies, the Human Genome Epidemiology (HuGE) literature finder and Cancer Genome-Wide Association and Meta Analyses Database (CancerGAMAdb), from January 1, 2001, to January 31, 2011. A supplemental search using HuGE was conducted for articles published from February 1, 2011, to April 11, 2013. A 25{\%} sample of the supplemental publications was reviewed. RESULTS A total of 3,019 articles were identified in the original search. From these articles, 243 articles were determined to be relevant based on inclusion criteria (more than 3,500 interactions). From the supplemental search (1,400 articles identified), 29 additional relevant articles (1,370 interactions) were included. The majority of publications in both searches examined G×E in colon, rectal, or colorectal; breast; or lung cancer. Specific interactions examined most frequently included environmental factors categorized as energy balance (e.g., body mass index, diet), exogenous (e.g., oral contraceptives) and endogenous hormones (e.g., menopausal status), chemical environment (e.g., grilled meats), and lifestyle (e.g., smoking, alcohol intake). In both searches, the majority of interactions examined were using loci from candidate genes studies and none of the studies were genome-wide interaction studies (GEWIS). The most commonly reported measure was the interaction P-value, of which a sizable number of P-values were considered statistically significant (i.e., {\textless}0.05). In addition, the magnitude of interactions reported was modest. CONCLUSION Observations of published literature suggest that opportunity exists for increased sample size in G×E research, including GWAS-identified loci in G×E studies, exploring more GWAS approaches in G×E such as GEWIS, and improving the reporting of G×E findings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Asthma genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several asthma susceptibility genes with confidence; however the relative contribution of these genetic variants or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to clinical endpoints (as opposed to disease diagnosis) remains largely unknown. Thus the aim of this study was to firstly bridge this gap in knowledge and secondly investigate whether these SNPs or those that are in linkage disequilibrium are likely to be functional candidates with respect to regulation of gene expression, using reported data from the ENCODE project. METHODS Eleven of the key SNPs identified in eight loci from recent asthma GWAS were evaluated for association with asthma and clinical outcomes, including percent predicted FEV1, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to methacholine, severity defined by British Thoracic Society steps and positive response to skin prick test, using the family based association test additive model in a well characterised UK cohort consisting of 370 families with at least two asthmatic children. RESULTS GSDMB SNP rs2305480 (Ser311Pro) was associated with asthma diagnosis (p = 8.9×10-4), BHR (p = 8.2×10-4) and severity (p = 1.5×10-4) with supporting evidence from a second GSDMB SNP rs11078927 (intronic). SNPs evaluated in IL33, IL18R1, IL1RL1, SMAD3, IL2RB, PDE4D, CRB1 and RAD50 did not show association with any phenotype tested when corrected for multiple testing. Analysis using ENCODE data provides further insight into the functional relevance of these SNPs. CONCLUSIONS Our results provide further support for the role of GSDMB SNPs in determining multiple asthma related phenotypes in childhood asthma including associations with lung function and disease severity.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer incidence rates markedly vary between countries. The highest rates of prostate cancer are observed in Western countries such as the United States, whereas the lowest rates are seen in Asian countries such as Singapore. To gain an understanding of the difference in prostate cancer burden between low-risk and high-risk populations, we examined serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels among Singapore-Chinese men (n = 315) from the Singapore Chinese Health Study and African-American (n = 440), U.S. White (n = 355), U.S. Latino (n = 523), and Japanese-American (n = 349) men from the Hawaii-Los Angeles Multiethnic Cohort Study. All men had no history of prostate cancer at the time of blood draw. PSA measurements were assayed by one centralized diagnostic facility. Testosterone and 3alpha-androstanediol glucuronide levels were examined in a subsample of men. Scheffe's multiple comparison tests were used to evaluate differences in PSA and hormone levels between groups. PSA levels among the Singapore-Chinese (geometric mean = 1.43 ng/mL) were similar to that of African-Americans (1.46 ng/mL), U.S. Whites (1.28 ng/mL), and Japanese-Americans (1.22 ng/mL) and significantly higher than U.S. Latinos (1.18 ng/mL; P = 0.038). Although there was a strong correlation (R2= 0.89) between PSA levels and U.S. ethnic group-specific prostate cancer incidence rates before PSA screening (1983-1987), the levels among the Singapore-Chinese completely failed to relate to their low incidence rate. Testosterone and 3alpha-androstanediol glucuronide levels did not reflect racial/ethnic patterns of disease. Our results highlight a potentially large group of Singapore-Chinese men with undiagnosed prostate cancer. Given that the overall mortality rate of prostate cancer in Singapore is low, these undiagnosed cancers may be of nonaggressive type. Alternatively, PSA may be a poor marker of prostate cancer in this low-risk population.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths among women aged 40-55 in the United States and currently affects more than one in ten women worldwide. It is also one of the most diagnosed cancers in women both in wealthy and poor countries. Fortunately, the mortality rate from breast cancer has decreased in recent years due to increased emphasis on early detection and more effective treatments in White population. Although the mortality rates have declined in some ethnic populations, the overall cancer incidence among African American and Hispanic populations has continued to grow. The goal of the present review article was to highlight similarities and differences in breast cancer morbidity and mortality rates primarily among African American women compared to White women in the United States. To reach our goal, we conducted a search of articles in journals with a primary focus on minority health, and authors who had published articles on racial/ethnic disparity related to breast cancer patients. A systematic search of original research was conducted using MEDLINE, PUBMED and Google Scholar databases. We found that racial/ethnic disparities in breast cancer may be attributed to a large number of clinical and non-clinical risk factors including lack of medical coverage, barriers to early detection and screening, more advanced stage of disease at diagnosis among minorities, and unequal access to improvements in cancer treatment. Many African American women have frequent unknown or unstaged breast cancers than White women. These risk factors may explain the differences in breast cancer treatment and survival rate between African American women and White women. New strategies and approaches are needed to promote breast cancer prevention, improve survival rate, reduce breast cancer mortality, and ultimately improve the health outcomes of racial/ethnic minorities.},

abstract = {PDE4 (phosphodiesterase-4) plays a critical role in pathogenesis of allergic asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). PDE4 inhibitors are presently under clinical development for the treatment of asthma and/or COPD. Ciclamilast, a new PDE4 inhibitor, is a piclamilast (RP 73401) structural analogue, but has a more potent inhibitory effect on PDE4 and inflammation in the airway tissues and less side effects than that of piclamilast. In this study, we elucidate primarily on the roles of compound on PDE4 enzyme in physiological and pathological processes in a mouse model of asthma. The sensitized/challenged mice were reexposed to ovalbumin and airway response to inhaled methacholine was monitored. Orally administration of ciclamilast, in a dose-dependent manner, significantly inhibited changes in lung resistance and lung dynamic compliance, as well as upregulation of cAMP-PDE activity, increase of PDE4D mRNA expression, but not PDE4B from lung tissue in the murine model. In addition, the compound dose-dependently reduced mRNA expression of eotaxin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$ and interleukin (IL)-4, but slightly increased mRNA expression of interferon (IFN)-$\gamma$ from lung tissue. Further, levels of eotaxin, TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-4, and eosinophil and neutrophil accumulation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were also significantly reduced. Pathological examination, goblet cell hyperplasia and inflammatory cells infiltration in lung tissue were suppressed by treatment with ciclamilast. A significant correlation was observed between the increases in PDE4D mRNA expression and airway hyperresponsiveness. These studies confirm that inhibitory effect of ciclamilast on airway hyperresponsiveness includes its inhibiting PDE4D mRNA expression, down-modulating PDE4 activity, anti-inflammation and anti-mucus hypersecretion, and ciclamilast may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of asthma. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about cancer survival among Hispanics, how it varies by Hispanic subgroup (Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Others), and how their survival patterns relate to the Hispanic Paradox.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We studied all 1.2 million cancer cases diagnosed during 1995-2003, in two states, Florida and Texas, according to three categories of outcome: highly fatal outcome, poor outcome, and moderate outcome. All were followed up until December 31, 2006. We calculated survival rates for each Hispanic subgroup, and using Cox regression, we studied the risk of death for each Hispanic subgroup compared with non-Hispanic Whites, adjusted for age, cancer site, and stage at diagnosis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Important differences in cancer survival were found according to Hispanic subgroup. For cancers of moderate outcome, the adjusted risk of death was higher among all Hispanic populations in comparison with non-Hispanic Whites: 6{\%} higher for Cubans, 11{\%} for Puerto Ricans, and 13{\%} for US-born Mexicans. Foreign-born Mexicans, even with incomplete follow-up, had a 24{\%} higher risk of death. For foreign-born Hispanics, except Cubans, the mortality follow-up of cancers of highly fatal outcome was insufficient, resulting in missing deaths and thus unrealistically high survival rates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: No evidence of a Hispanic advantage was found in cancer survival. Improvement in mortality follow-up procedures for Latinos, especially for those without a valid social security number, is critical. By considering Hispanics as a whole rather than by subgroup, existing survival disparities are being missed.},

abstract = {This chapter summarises the results of the preceding sections, which estimate the fraction of cancers occurring in the UK in 2010 that can be attributed to sub-optimal, past exposures of 14 lifestyle and environmental risk factors. For each of 18 cancer types, we present the percentage of cases attributable to one or all of the risk factors considered (tobacco, alcohol, four elements of diet (consumption of meat, fruit and vegetables, fibre, and salt), overweight, lack of physical exercise, occupation, infections, radiation (ionising and solar), use of hormones, and reproductive history (breast feeding)). Exposure to less than optimum levels of the 14 factors was responsible for 42.7{\%} of cancers in the UK in 2010 (45.3{\%} in men, 40.1{\%} in women) – a total of about 134 000 cases. Tobacco smoking is by far the most important risk factor for cancer in the UK, responsible for 60 000 cases (19.4{\%} of all new cancer cases) in 2010. The relative importance of other exposures differs by sex. In men, deficient intake of fruits and vegetables (6.1{\%}), occupational exposures (4.9{\%}) and alcohol consumption (4.6{\%}) are next in importance, while in women, it is overweight and obesity (because of the effect on breast cancer) – responsible for 6.9{\%} of cancers, followed by infectious agents (3.7{\%}). Population-attributable fractions provide a valuable quantitative appraisal of the impact of different factors in cancer causation, and are thus helpful in prioritising cancer control strategies. However, quantifying the likely impact of preventive interventions requires rather complex scenario modelling, including specification of realistically achievable population distributions of risk factors, and the timescale of change, as well as the latent periods between exposure and outcome, and the rate of change following modification in exposure level.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The causal nature of associations between circulating triglycerides, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes is unclear. We aimed to use Mendelian randomization to test the hypothesis that raised circulating triglyceride levels causally influence the risk of type 2 diabetes and raise normal fasting glucose levels and hepatic insulin resistance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We tested 10 common genetic variants robustly associated with circulating triglyceride levels against the type 2 diabetes status in 5,637 case and 6,860 control subjects and four continuous outcomes (reflecting glycemia and hepatic insulin resistance) in 8,271 nondiabetic individuals from four studies. RESULTS: Individuals carrying greater numbers of triglyceride-raising alleles had increased circulating triglyceride levels (SD 0.59 [95{\%} CI 0.52-0.65] difference between the 20{\%} of individuals with the most alleles and the 20{\%} with the fewest alleles). There was no evidence that the carriers of greater numbers of triglyceride-raising alleles were at increased risk of type 2 diabetes (per weighted allele odds ratio [OR] 0.99 [95{\%} CI 0.97-1.01]; P = 0.26). In nondiabetic individuals, there was no evidence that carriers of greater numbers of triglyceride-raising alleles had increased fasting insulin levels (SD 0.00 per weighted allele [95{\%} CI -0.01 to 0.02]; P = 0.72) or increased fasting glucose levels (0.00 [-0.01 to 0.01]; P = 0.88). Instrumental variable analyses confirmed that genetically raised circulating triglyceride levels were not associated with increased diabetes risk, fasting glucose, or fasting insulin and, for diabetes, showed a trend toward a protective association (OR per 1-SD increase in log(10) triglycerides: 0.61 [95{\%} CI 0.45-0.83]; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Genetically raised circulating triglyceride levels do not increase the risk of type 2 diabetes or raise fasting glucose or fasting insulin levels in nondiabetic individuals. One explanation for our results is that raised circulating triglycerides are predominantly secondary to the diabetes disease process rather than causal.},

abstract = {Exhaustive testing of all possible SNP pairs in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) generally yields low power to detect gene-gene (G × G) interactions because of small effect sizes and stringent requirements for multiple-testing correction. We introduce a new two-step procedure for testing G × G interactions in case-control GWAS to detect interacting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) regardless of their marginal effects. In an initial screening step, all SNP pairs are tested for gene-gene association in the combined sample of cases and controls. In the second step, the pairs that pass the screening are followed up with a traditional test for G × G interaction. We show that the two-step method is substantially more powerful to detect G × G interactions than the exhaustive testing approach. For example, with 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls, the two-step method can have more than 90{\%} power to detect an interaction odds ratio of 2.0 compared to less than 50{\%} power for the exhaustive testing approach. Moreover, we show that a hybrid two-step approach that combines our newly proposed two-step test and the two-step test that screens for marginal effects retains the best power properties of both. The two-step procedures we introduce have the potential to uncover genetic signals that have not been previously identified in an initial single-SNP GWAS. We demonstrate the computational feasibility of the two-step G × G procedure by performing a G × G scan in the asthma GWAS of the University of Southern California Children's Health Study.},

A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional familywise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of prac-tical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the proce-dure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},

abstract = {Heterocyclic amines (HAAs) and polycyclic hydrocarbons are suspected colorectal cancer (CRC) carcinogens that are found in well-done meat. They require metabolic activation by phase I enzymes, such as the smoking-inducible CYP1A isoenzymes. N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) also play a role in the further activation of HAAs. We conducted a population-based case-control study in Hawaii to test the associations of preference for well-done red meat and HAA intake with colon and rectal cancers, as well as the modifying effects of NAT2 and CYP1A2. We interviewed 727 Japanese, Caucasian or Native Hawaiian cases and 727 controls matched on sex, age, and ethnicity. HAA intake was estimated based on consumption of meat and fish for each of several cooking methods and doneness levels. A subgroup of 349 cases and 467 controls was phenotyped for CYP1A2 by a caffeine test. We found that preference for well-done red meat was associated with a 8.8-fold increased risk of CRC (95{\%} CI: 1.7-44.9) among ever-smokers with the NAT2 and CYP1A2 rapid phenotypes, compared to ever-smokers with low NAT2 and CYP1A2 activities and who preferred their red meat rare or medium. A dose-dependent association was also found between the HAA intake estimates and male rectal cancer, with a two- to three-fold increase in risk from the low (T1) to high (T3) tertile of intake for each HAA. This association was strongest for MeIQx. HAA intake was not associated with male colon cancer or colon or rectal cancer in women. These data provide support to the hypothesis that exposure to pyrolysis products through consumption of well-done meat increases the risk of CRC, particularly in individuals who smoke and are genetically susceptible (as determined by a rapid phenotype for both NAT2 and CYP1A2). An attempt to examine the risk associated with specific HAAs suggested that the main HAAs increase risk of rectal cancer in men and that they do not appreciably affect risk of rectal cancer in women or of colon cancer in either sex. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {PURPOSE Macrophages play a major role in inflammatory processes and have been associated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancers, including breast cancer. Previously, we investigated the relationship of a subset of tumor-associated macrophages (PCNA(+) TAMs) with clinicopathologic characteristics of breast cancer. We reported that high PCNA(+) TAM counts were associated with hormone receptor (HR)-negative, high-grade tumors and early recurrence. To further understand the significance of elevated PCNA(+) TAMs and the functionality of TAMs, we examined the expression of S100A8/S100A9 with the antibody Mac387. The heterodimeric S100A8/S100A9 complex plays a role in inflammation and is increased in several cancer types. METHODS We performed immunohistochemistry using the Mac387 antibody on 367 invasive human breast cancer cases. Results were compared to previous PCNA(+) TAM counts and were correlated with patient outcomes adjusting for HR status and histologic grade. RESULTS Like PCNA(+) TAMs, high Mac387 counts were associated with HR negativity, high tumor grade, younger age, and decreased recurrence-free survival. Mac387, however, appears to identify both a subset of macrophages and a subset of tumor cells. The concordance between Mac387 and PCNA(+) TAM counts was low and cases that had both high Mac387 and high PCNA(+) TAMs counts had a stronger association with early recurrence. CONCLUSIONS The presence of high numbers of PCNA(+) TAMs and Mac387-positive cells in breast cancers with poor outcomes may implicate a subset of TAMs in breast cancer pathogenesis, and may ultimately serve to develop potential cellular targets for therapeutic interventions.},

abstract = {Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease characterized by impaired lung function and airway obstruction resulting from interactions between multiple genes and multiple environmental exposures. Thus far, genome-wide association studies have largely disregarded environmental factors that might trigger the development of lung function impairment and COPD, such as occupational exposures, which are thought to contribute to 15{\%} to 20{\%} of the COPD prevalence. Objectives We performed a genome-wide interaction study to identify novel susceptibility loci for occupational exposure to biological dust, mineral dust, and gases and fumes in relation to FEV1levels. Methods We performed an identification analysis in 12,400 subjects from the LifeLines cohort study and verified our findings in 1436 subjects from a second independent cohort, the Vlagtwedde-Vlaardingen cohort. Additionally, we assessed whether replicated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were cis-acting expression (mRNA) quantitative trait loci in lung tissue. Results Of the 7 replicated SNPs that interacted with one of the occupational exposures, several identified loci were plausible candidates that might be involved in biological pathways leading to lung function impairment, such as PCDH9 and GALNT13. Two of the 7 replicated SNPs were cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci associated with gene expression of PDE4D and TMEM176A in lung tissue. Conclusion This genome-wide interaction study on occupational exposures in relation to the level of lung function identified several novel genes. Further research should determine whether the identified genes are true susceptibility loci for occupational exposures and whether these SNP-by-exposure interactions consequently contribute to the development of COPD.},

abstract = {Background A supportive youth cigarette social environment, e.g. friends' approval of use, leads to cigarette use initiation, and cigarette users develop a more supportive social environment. Whether there is a bidirectional relationship of e-cigarette social environment with e-cigarette use has not been studied. Methods Prospective data were collected from 1441 Children's Health Study participants in 2014 (median age=17.3 years) and at follow-up 1.5 years later. Associations were examined of (1) supportive e-cigarette social environment with subsequent e-cigarette use initiation and (2) of baseline e-cigarette use with supportive e-cigarette social environment at follow-up (among those with a non-supportive baseline social environment). Results Participants with 3-4 friends using e-cigarettes at baseline (vs. no friends) had an odds ratio (OR) of 4.08 of subsequent initiation (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.96,8.49); those with best friends who would have a very friendly (vs. unfriendly) reaction to e-cigarette use had OR 2.54 of initiation (95{\%}CI: 1.57,4.10); and those with someone in the home using e-cigarettes had OR 1.94 of initiation (95{\%}CI: 1.19,3.15). Participants who had ever used e-cigarettes at baseline developed a supportive social environment at follow-up (OR 2.06 of having any friends who used e-cigarettes (95{\%}CI: 1.29, 3.30) and OR 2.33 of having friends who were friendly toward use (95{\%}CI: 1.32, 4.11). Similar bidirectional associations were observed between ever cigarette use and a supportive cigarette social environment. Conclusions The bidirectional relationship between a supportive e-cigarette social environment and ever use of e-cigarettes was similar to that previously observed between cigarette social environment and cigarette use. Implications Disrupting the social acceptability of youth e-cigarette use merits consideration as a strategy for preventing initiation of e-cigarette use, just as the social de-normalization of cigarette use has proven to be effective in preventing cigarette initiation.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants robustly associated with complex traits. However, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are, in general, not well understood. We propose a gene-based association method called PrediXcan that directly tests the molecular mechanisms through which genetic variation affects phenotype. The approach estimates the component of gene expression determined by an individual's genetic profile and correlates 'imputed' gene expression with the phenotype under investigation to identify genes involved in the etiology of the phenotype. Genetically regulated gene expression is estimated using whole-genome tissue-dependent prediction models trained with reference transcriptome data sets. PrediXcan enjoys the benefits of gene-based approaches such as reduced multiple-testing burden and a principled approach to the design of follow-up experiments. Our results demonstrate that PrediXcan can detect known and new genes associated with disease traits and provide insights into the mechanism of these associations.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified common variants that are associated with complex diseases. However, the majority of genetic variants contributing to disease susceptibility are yet to be discovered. It is now widely believed that multiple rare variants are likely to be associated with complex diseases. Using custom-made chips or next-generation sequencing to uncover the effects of rare variants on the disease can be very expensive in current technology. Consequently, many researchers use the genotype imputation approach to predict the genotypes at these rare variants that are not directly genotyped in the study sample. One important question in genotype imputation is how to choose a reference panel that will produce high imputation accuracy in a population of interest. Using whole genome sequence data from the Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 data set, this report compares genotype imputation accuracy among reference panels representing different degrees of genetic similarity to a study sample of admixed Mexican Americans. Results show that a reference panel that closely matches the ancestry of the study population can increase imputation accuracy, but it can also result in more missing genotype calls. Having a larger-size reference panel can reduce imputation error and missing genotype, but the improvement may be limited. We also find that, for the admixed study sample, the simple selection of a single best-reference panel among HapMap African, European, or Asian population is not appropriate. The composite reference panel combining all available reference data should be used.},

abstract = {We investigated the effects of individual fatty acids on breast cancer in a prospective study of 35,298 Singapore Chinese women aged 45-74 years, who were enrolled during April 1993 to December 1998 (The Singapore Chinese Health Study). At recruitment, each study subject was administered, in-person, a validated, semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire consisting of 165 food and beverage items. As of December 31, 2000, 314 incident cases of breast cancer had occurred. We used the Cox regression methods to examine individual fatty acids in relation to breast cancer risk, with adjustment for age at baseline interview, year of interview, dialect group, level of education, daily alcohol drinking, number of live births, age when menstrual periods became regular, and family history of breast cancer. Consumption of saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat overall was unrelated to risk. On the other hand, high levels of dietary n-3 fatty acids from fish/shellfish (marine n-3 fatty acids) were significantly associated with reduced risk. Relative to the lowest quartile of intake, individuals in the higher three quartiles exhibited a 26{\%} reduction in risk (relative risk (RR)=0.74, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=0.58, 0.94)); RRs were similar across the top three quartiles of intake (0.75, 0.75, 0.72, respectively). Overall, there was no association between n-6 fatty acids and breast cancer risk. However, among subjects who consumed low levels of marine n-3 fatty acids (lowest quartile of intake), a statistically significant increase in risk was observed in individuals belonging to the highest vs the lowest quartile of n-6 fatty acid consumption (RR=1.87, 95{\%} CI=1.06-3.27); the corresponding RR for advanced breast cancer was 2.45 (95{\%} CI=1.20-4.97, P for trend=0.01). To our knowledge, these are the first prospective findings linking the intake of marine n-3 fatty acids to breast cancer protection.},

Epidemiologic and dietary data were collected via an in-person interview. Compared to the lowest quartile of red meat intake, the odds ratios (ORs) for the second, third and fourth quartiles were 1.17 (95{\%} CI: 0.87-1.58), 1.47 (95{\%} CI: 1.09-1.99) and 1.95 (95{\%} CI: 1.41-2.68), respectively, (p-for trend {\textless}0.001).

Moreover, subjects carrying six or more unfavorable genotypes and whose red meat intake was in the highest quartile were at 5.09-fold increased risk (95{\%} CI: 2.89-8.96; p {\textless} 0.001). These results strongly support that high red meat intake, high intake of HCAs and carrying high number of unfavorable genotypes in the HCA metabolic pathways are associated with increased risk of BC in the study population.},

abstract = {The relationship between tobacco smoking and prostate cancer (PCa) remains inconclusive. This study examined the association between tobacco smoking and PCa risk taking into account polymorphisms in carcinogen metabolism enzyme genes as possible effect modifiers (9 polymorphisms and 1 predicted phenotype from metabolism enzyme genes). The study included cases (n = 761 localized; n = 1199 advanced) and controls (n = 1139) from the multiethnic California Collaborative Case-Control Study of Prostate Cancer. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between tobacco smoking variables and risk of localized and advanced PCa risk. Being a former smoker, regardless of time of quit smoking, was associated with an increased risk of localized PCa (odds ratio [OR] = 1.3; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-1.6). Among non-Hispanic Whites, ever smoking was associated with an increased risk of localized PCa (OR = 1.5; 95{\%} CI = 1.1-2.1), whereas current smoking was associated with risk of advanced PCa (OR = 1.4; 95{\%} CI = 1.0-1.9). However, no associations were observed between smoking intensity, duration or pack-year variables, and advanced PCa. No statistically significant trends were seen among Hispanics or African-Americans. The relationship between smoking status and PCa risk was modified by the CYP1A2 rs7662551 polymorphism (P-interaction = 0.008). In conclusion, tobacco smoking was associated with risk of PCa, primarily localized disease among non-Hispanic Whites. This association was modified by a genetic variant in CYP1A2, thus supporting a role for tobacco carcinogens in PCa risk.},

abstract = {Background Recently, several genome-wide association studies have identified various genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. Relatively little is known about the possible interactions between these loci and the established risk factors for breast cancer. Methods To assess interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and established risk factors, we prospectively collected DNA samples and questionnaire data from 8576 breast cancer case subjects and 11 892 control subjects nested within the National Cancer Institute's Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3). We genotyped 17 germline SNPs (FGFR2-rs2981582, FGFR2-rs3750817, TNRC9-rs3803662, 2q35-rs13387042, MAP3K1-rs889312, 8q24-rs13281615, CASP8-rs1045485, LSP1-rs3817198, COL1A1-rs2075555, COX11-rs6504950, RNF146-rs2180341, 6q25-rs2046210, SLC4A7-rs4973768, NOTCH2-rs11249433, 5p12-rs4415084, 5p12-rs10941679, RAD51L1-rs999737), and odds ratios were estimated by logistic regression to confirm previously reported associations with breast cancer risk. We performed likelihood ratio test to assess interactions between 17 SNPs and nine established risk factors (age at menarche, parity, age at menopause, use of hormone replacement therapy, family history, height, body mass index, smoking status, and alcohol consumption), and a correction for multiple testing of 153 tests (adjusted P value threshold = .05/153 = 3 × 10(-4)) was done. Case-case comparisons were performed for possible differential associations of polymorphisms by subgroups of tumor stage, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, and age at diagnosis. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results We confirmed the association of 14 SNPs with breast cancer risk (P(trend) = 2.57 × 10(-3) -3.96 × 10(-19)). Three SNPs (LSP1-rs3817198, COL1A1-rs2075555, and RNF146-rs2180341) did not show association with breast cancer risk. After accounting for multiple testing, no statistically significant interactions were detected between the 17 SNPs and the nine risk factors. We also confirmed that SNPs in FGFR2 and TNRC9 were associated with greater risk of estrogen receptor-positive than estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer (P(heterogeneity) = .0016 for FGFR2-rs2981582 and P(heterogeneity) = .0053 for TNRC9-rs3803662). SNP 5p12-rs10941679 was statistically significantly associated with greater risk of progesterone receptor-positive than progesterone receptor-negative breast cancer (P(heterogeneity) = .0028). Conclusion This study does not support the hypothesis that known common breast cancer susceptibility loci strongly modify the associations between established risk factors and breast cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Studies of the effect of vitamin B12 and folate on the risk of asthma and hay fever have shown inconsistent results that may be biased by reverse causation and confounding. We used a Mendelian randomization approach to examine a potential causal effect of vitamin B12 and folate on hay fever, asthma, and selected biomarkers of allergy by using 11 vitamin B12-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 2 folate-associated SNPs as unconfounded markers. SUBJECTS/METHODS We included 162,736 participants from 9 population-based studies including the UK Biobank. Results were combined in instrumental variable and meta-analyses and effects expressed as odds ratios (ORs) or estimates with 95{\%} confidence interval (CI). RESULTS Using genetic proxies for B12 and folate, instrumental variable analyses did not show evidence for associations between serum B12 and hay fever: OR = 1.02 (95{\%} CI: 0.98, 1.05), asthma: OR = 0.99 (95{\%} CI: 0.95, 1.04), allergic sensitization: OR = 1.02 (95{\%} CI: 0.74, 1.40), or change in serum IgE: 10.0{\%} (95{\%} CI: -9.6{\%}, 29.6{\%}) per 100 pg/ml B12. Similarly, there was no evidence for association between serum folate and hay fever: OR = 0.74 (95{\%} CI: 0.45, 1.21), asthma: OR = 0.80 (95{\%} CI: 0.43, 1.49), or allergic sensitization: OR = 1.92 (95{\%} CI: 0.11, 33.45), but there was a statistically significant association with change in serum IgE: 2.0{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.43{\%}, 3.58{\%}) per 0.1 ng/ml serum folate. CONCLUSIONS Our results did not support the hypothesis that levels of vitamin B12 and folate are causally related to hay fever, asthma, or biomarkers of allergy, but we found evidence of a positive association between serum folate and serum total IgE.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mutagenic compounds produced when meats are cooked at high temperatures have been hypothesized to increase risk of breast cancer. METHODS We examined the association between intakes of the heterocyclic amines (HCA) MeIQx (2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline), PhIP (2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine), DiMeIQx (2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]), and meat-derived mutagenic (MDM) activity and risk of breast cancer using a cooking method questionnaire administered in 1996 in the Nurses' Health Study. Between 1996 and 2006, 2,317 breast cancer cases were diagnosed during 533,618 person-years. RESULTS Higher intake of HCAs or MDM was not associated with elevated risk of breast cancer [multivariate relative risk and 95{\%} confidence interval for the highest versus lowest quintile: MeIQx: 0.90 (0.79-1.03); PhIP: 0.92 (0.80-1.05); DiMeIQx: 0.92 (0.80-1.05); and MDM: 0.98 (0.85-1.12)]. HCA or MDM was not associated with estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer risk either. There was some suggestion of a decreased risk of estrogen receptor-negative/progesterone receptor-negative breast cancer with higher intakes of MeIQx, DiMeIQx, and PhIP, but none of the associations were statistically significant. There was little evidence for an interaction between intake of cruciferous vegetables and HCA or MDM intake and risk of breast cancer. CONCLUSION Higher consumption of mutagens from meats cooked at higher temperature and longer duration was not associated with increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. IMPACT Overall prospective data including results from our study do not provide support for a substantial increase in risk of breast cancer with higher intake of HCAs.},

We calculated summary odds ratios (OR) for risk factors reported in at least five studies, including socioeconomic status (education), lifestyle habits (smoking and alcohol use), dietary factors (consumption of fruits, total vegetables, green vegetables, chili pepper, total meat, processed meat, red meat, fish, and salt), and host genetic variants (IL1B-511T, IL1B-31C, IL1RN*2, TNFA-308A, TP53 codon 72 Arg, and GSTM1 null). Study-specific ORs were extracted and summarized using random-effects models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Chili pepper was the only region-specific factor reported in at least five studies. Consistent with multifactorial pathogenesis, smoking, alcohol use, high consumption of red meat or processed meat, excessive salt intake, and carriage of IL1RN*2 were each associated with a moderate increase in gastric cancer risk. Conversely, higher levels of education, fruit consumption, and total vegetable consumption were each associated with a moderately decreased risk. The other exposures were not significantly associated. No prospective study data were identified.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Risk factor associations for gastric cancer in Latin America are based on case-control comparisons that have uncertain reliability, particularly with regard to diet; the specific factors identified and their magnitudes of association are largely similar to those globally recognized. Future studies should emphasize prospective data collection and focus on region-specific exposures that may explain high gastric cancer risk.},

abstract = {Standard statistical approaches for prioritization of variants for functional testing in fine-mapping studies either use marginal association statistics or estimate posterior probabilities for variants to be causal under simplifying assumptions. Here, we present a probabilistic framework that integrates association strength with functional genomic annotation data to improve accuracy in selecting plausible causal variants for functional validation. A key feature of our approach is that it empirically estimates the contribution of each functional annotation to the trait of interest directly from summary association statistics while allowing for multiple causal variants at any risk locus. We devise efficient algorithms that estimate the parameters of our model across all risk loci to further increase performance. Using simulations starting from the 1000 Genomes data, we find that our framework consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art fine-mapping methods, reducing the number of variants that need to be selected to capture 90{\%} of the causal variants from an average of 13.3 to 10.4 SNPs per locus (as compared to the next-best performing strategy). Furthermore, we introduce a cost-to-benefit optimization framework for determining the number of variants to be followed up in functional assays and assess its performance using real and simulation data. We validate our findings using a large scale meta-analysis of four blood lipids traits and find that the relative probability for causality is increased for variants in exons and transcription start sites and decreased in repressed genomic regions at the risk loci of these traits. Using these highly predictive, trait-specific functional annotations, we estimate causality probabilities across all traits and variants, reducing the size of the 90{\%} confidence set from an average of 17.5 to 13.5 variants per locus in this data.},

abstract = {Red meat consumption is associated with an increased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, which may be due to an increased endogenous formation of genotoxic N-nitroso compounds (NOCs). To assess the impact of red meat consumption on potential risk factors of CRC, we investigated the effect of a 7-day dietary red meat intervention in human subjects on endogenous NOC formation and fecal water genotoxicity in relation to genome-wide transcriptomic changes induced in colonic tissue. The intervention showed no effect on fecal NOC excretion but fecal water genotoxicity significantly increased in response to red meat intake. Colonic inflammation caused by inflammatory bowel disease, which has been suggested to stimulate endogenous nitrosation, did not influence fecal NOC excretion or fecal water genotoxicity. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that genes significantly correlating with the increase in fecal water genotoxicity were involved in biological pathways indicative of genotoxic effects, including modifications in DNA damage repair, cell cycle, and apoptosis pathways. Moreover, WNT signaling and nucleosome remodeling pathways were modulated which are implicated in human CRC development. We conclude that the gene expression changes identified in this study corroborate the genotoxic potential of diets high in red meat and point towards a potentially increased CRC risk in humans. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Genotype imputation has become an essential tool in the analysis of genome-wide association scans. This technique allows investigators to test association at ungenotyped genetic markers, and to combine results across studies that rely on different genotyping platforms. In addition, imputation is used within long-running studies to reuse genotypes produced across generations of platforms. Typically, genotypes of controls are reused and cases are genotyped on more novel platforms yielding a case-control study that is not matched for genotyping platforms. In this study, we scrutinize such a situation and validate GWAS results by actually retyping top-ranking SNPs with the Sequenom MassArray platform. We discuss the needed quality controls (QCs). In doing so, we report a considerable discrepancy between the results from imputed and retyped data when applying recommended QCs from the literature. These discrepancies appear to be caused by extrapolating differences between arrays by the process of imputation. To avoid false positive results, we recommend that more stringent QCs should be applied. We also advocate reporting the imputation quality measure (R(T)(2)) for the post-imputation QCs in publications.},

abstract = {Confounding is a major concern in causal studies because it results in biased estimation of exposure effects. In the extreme, this can mean that a causal effect is suggested where none exists, or that a true effect is hidden. Typically, confounding occurs when there are differences between the exposed and unexposed groups in respect of independent risk factors for the disease of interest, for example, age or smoking habit; these independent factors are called confounders. Confounding can be reduced by matching in the study design but this can be difficult and/or wasteful of resources. Another possible approach—assuming data on the confounder(s) have been gathered—is to apply a statistical ‘‘correction'' method during analysis. Such methods produce ‘‘adjusted'' or ‘‘corrected'' estimates of the effect of exposure; in theory, these estimates are no longer biased by the erstwhile confounders. Given the importance of confounding in epidemiology, statistical methods said to remove it deserve scrutiny. Many such methods involve strong assumptions about data relationships and their validity may depend on whether these assumptions are justified. Historically, the most common statistical approach for dealing with confounding in epidemiology was based on stratification; the standardised mortality ratio is a well known statistic using this method to remove confounding by age. Increasingly, this approach is being replaced by methods based on regression models. This article is a simple introduction to the latter methods with the emphasis on showing how they work, their assumptions, and how they compare with other methods. Before applying a statistical correction method, one has to decide which factors are con- founders. This sometimes1–4 complex issue is not discussed in detail and for the most part the examples will assume that age is a confounder. However, the use of automated statistical procedures for choosing variables to include in a regression model is discussed in the context of confounding.},

Cases had at least one laboratory and clinician confirmed disease caused by S. aureus whereas controls did not.

abstract = {Meat is a crucial nutrient for human health since it represents a giant supply of proteins, minerals, and vitamins. On the opposite hand, the intake of red and processed meat is taken into account dangerous due to its potential of carcinogenesis and cancer risk improvement, particularly for colorectal cancer (CRC), although it has been reported that also the contaminations of beef infected by oncogenic bovine viruses could increase colorectal cancer's risk. Regarding the mechanisms underlying the potential carcinogenicity of red and processed meat, different hypotheses have been proposed. A suggested mechanism describes the potential role of the heterocyclic amines (HACs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAs) in carcinogenesis induced by DNA mutation. Another hypothesis states that heme, through the lipid peroxidation process and therefore the formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOCs), produces cytotoxic and genotoxic aldehydes, resulting in carcinogenesis. Furthermore, a recent proposed hypothesis, is based on the combined actions between the N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and genotoxic compounds. The purpose of this narrative review is to shed a light on the mechanisms underlying the potential carcinogenicity of red and processed meat, by summarizing the data reported in literature on this topic.},

abstract = {Marine-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to inhibit mammary carcinogenesis. However, evidence regarding plant-based $\alpha$-linolenic acid (ALA), the major n-3 PUFA in the Western diet, remains equivocal. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of lifelong exposure to plant- or marine-derived n-3 PUFAs on pubertal mammary gland and tumor development in MMTV-neu(ndl)-YD5 mice. It is hypothesized that lifelong exposure to n-3 PUFA reduces terminal end buds during puberty leading to delayed tumor onset, volume and multiplicity. It is further hypothesized that plant-derived n-3 PUFAs will exert dose-dependent effects. Harems of MMTV-FVB males were bred with wild-type females and fed either a (1) 10{\%} safflower (10{\%} SF, n-6 PUFA, control), (2) 10{\%} flaxseed (10{\%} FS), (3) 7{\%} safflower plus 3{\%} flaxseed (3{\%} FS) or (4) 7{\%} safflower plus 3{\%} menhaden (3{\%} FO) diet. Female offspring were maintained on parental diets. Compared to SF, 10{\%} FS and 3{\%} FO reduced (P{\textless}.05) terminal end buds at 6 weeks and tumor volume and multiplicity at 20 weeks. A dose-dependent reduction of tumor volume and multiplicity was observed in mice fed 3{\%} and 10{\%} FS. Antitumorigenic effects were associated with altered HER2, pHER-2, pAkt and Ki-67 protein expression. Compared to 10{\%} SF, 3{\%} FO significantly down-regulated expression of genes involved in eicosanoid synthesis and inflammation. From this, it can be estimated that ALA was 1/8 as potent as EPA+DHA. Thus, marine-derived n-3 PUFAs have greater potency versus plant-based n-3 PUFAs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use has been consistently associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in women. Our aim was to use a genome-wide gene-environment interaction analysis to identify genetic modifiers of CRC risk associated with use of MHT. METHODS We included 10 835 postmenopausal women (5419 cases and 5416 controls) from 10 studies. We evaluated use of any MHT, oestrogen-only (E-only) and combined oestrogen-progestogen (E+P) hormone preparations. To test for multiplicative interactions, we applied the empirical Bayes (EB) test as well as the Wald test in conventional case-control logistic regression as primary tests. The Cocktail test was used as secondary test. RESULTS The EB test identified a significant interaction between rs964293 at 20q13.2/CYP24A1 and E+P (interaction OR (95{\%} CIs)=0.61 (0.52-0.72), P=4.8 × 10(-9)). The secondary analysis also identified this interaction (Cocktail test OR=0.64 (0.52-0.78), P=1.2 × 10(-5) (alpha threshold=3.1 × 10(-4)). The ORs for association between E+P and CRC risk by rs964293 genotype were as follows: C/C, 0.96 (0.61-1.50); A/C, 0.61 (0.39-0.95) and A/A, 0.40 (0.22-0.73), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that rs964293 modifies the association between E+P and CRC risk. The variant is located near CYP24A1, which encodes an enzyme involved in vitamin D metabolism. This novel finding offers additional insight into downstream pathways of CRC etiopathogenesis.},

abstract = {Association studies among admixed populations pose many challenges including confounding of genetic effects due to population substructure and heterogeneity due to different patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD). We use simulations to investigate controlling for confounding by indicators of global ancestry and the impact of including a covariate for local ancestry. In addition, we investigate the use of an interaction term between a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and local ancestry to capture heterogeneity in SNP effects. Although adjustment for global ancestry can control for confounding, additional adjustment for local ancestry may increase power when the induced admixture LD is in the opposite direction as the LD in the ancestral population. However, if the induced LD is in the same direction, there is the potential for reduced power because of overadjustment. Furthermore, the inclusion of a SNP by local ancestry interaction term can increase power when there is substantial differential LD between ancestry populations. We examine these approaches in genome-wide data using the University of Southern California's Children's Health Study investigating asthma risk. The analysis highlights rs10519951 (P = 8.5 × 10(-7)), a SNP lacking any evidence of association from a conventional analysis (P = 0.5).},

abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous environmental carcinogens and metabolized by a variety of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP), epoxide hydrolase, glutathione transferase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, sulfotransferase, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1, and aldo-keto reductase. These enzymes mainly participate in the conversion of PAHs to more polar and water-soluble metabolites, and the resultant metabolites are readily excreted from the body. However, during the course of metabolism, a variety of unstable and reactive intermediates of PAHs are formed, and these metabolites attack DNA, causing cell toxicity and transformation. P450s and epoxide hydrolase convert PAHs to proximate carcinogenic metabolites, PAH-diols, and these products are further metabolized by P450s to ultimate carcinogenic metabolites, PAH diol-epoxides, or by aldo-keto reductase to reactive PAH o-quinones. PAHs are also activated by P450 and peroxidases to reactive radical cations that bind covalently to DNA. The oxygenated and reactive metabolites of PAHs are usually converted to more polar and detoxified products by phase II enzymes. Inter-individual differences exist in levels of expression and catalytic activities of a variety of enzymes that activate and/or detoxify PAHs in various organs of humans and these phenomena are thought to be critical in understanding the basis of individual differences in response to PAHs. Factors affecting such variations include induction and inhibition of enzymes by diverse chemicals and, more importantly, genetic polymorphisms of enzymes in humans.},

NF-$\kappa$B is frequently hyperactivated in several cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer. Here we show that NF-$\kappa$B activation in breast cancer cells depends on the presence of the CHORDC1 gene product Morgana, a previously unknown component of the IKK complex and essential for I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ substrate recognition. Morgana silencing blocks metastasis formation in breast cancer mouse models and this phenotype is reverted by I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ downregulation. High Morgana expression levels in cancer cells decrease recruitment of natural killer cells in the first phases of tumor growth and induce the expression of cytokines able to attract neutrophils in the primary tumor, as well as in the pre-metastatic lungs, fueling cancer metastasis. In accordance, high Morgana levels positively correlate with NF-$\kappa$B target gene expression and poor prognosis in human patients.},

abstract = {Background. Cancer incidence rates vary considerably between countries and by socioeconomic status (SES). We investigate the impact of SES upon the relative cancer risk in two neighbouring countries. Methods. Data on 229,824 cases for 16 cancers diagnosed in 1995-2007 were extracted from the cancer registries in Northern Ireland (NI) and Republic of Ireland (RoI). Cancers in the two countries were compared using incidence rate ratios (IRRs) adjusted for age and age plus area-based SES. Results. Adjusting for SES in addition to age had a considerable impact on NI/RoI comparisons for cancers strongly related to SES. Before SES adjustment, lung cancer incidence rates were 11{\%} higher for males and 7{\%} higher for females in NI, while after adjustment, the IRR was not statistically significant. Cervical cancer rates were lower in NI than in RoI after adjustment for age (IRR: 0.90 (0.84-0.97)), with this difference increasing after adjustment for SES (IRR: 0.85 (0.79-0.92)). For cancers with a weak or nonexistent relationship to SES, adjustment for SES made little difference to the IRR. Conclusion. Socioeconomic factors explain some international variations but also obscure other crucial differences; thus, adjustment for these factors should not become part of international comparisons.},

abstract = {Imputation is a commonly used technique that exploits linkage disequilibrium to infer missing genotypes in genetic datasets, using a well characterized reference population. While there is agreement that the reference population has to match the ethnicity of the query dataset, it is common practice to use the same reference to impute genotypes for a wide variety of phenotypes. We hypothesized that using a reference composed of samples with a different phenotype than the query dataset would introduce imputation bias. To test this hypothesis we used GWAS datasets from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, and Crohn disease. First, we masked and then performed imputation of 100 disease-associated markers and 100 non-associated markers from each study. Two references for imputation were used in parallel: one consisting of healthy controls and another consisting of patients with the same disease. We assessed the discordance (imprecision) and bias (inaccuracy) of imputation by comparing predicted genotypes to those assayed by SNP-chip. We also assessed the bias on the observed effect size when the predicted genotypes were used in a GWAS study. When healthy controls were used as reference for imputation, a significant bias was observed, particularly in the disease-associated markers. Using cases as reference significantly attenuated this bias. For nearly all markers, the direction of the bias favored the non-risk allele. In GWAS studies of the three diseases (with healthy reference controls from the 1000 genomes as reference), the mean OR for disease-associated markers obtained by imputation was lower than that obtained using original assayed genotypes. We found that the bias is inherent to imputation as using different methods did not alter the results. In conclusion, imputation is a powerful method to predict genotypes and estimate genetic risk for GWAS. However, a careful choice of reference population is needed to minimize biases inherent to this approach},

abstract = {An efficient testing strategy called the "focused interaction testing framework" (FITF) was developed to identify susceptibility genes involved in epistatic interactions for case-control studies of candidate genes. In the FITF approach, likelihood-ratio tests are performed in stages that increase in the order of interaction considered. Joint tests of main effects and interactions are performed conditional on significant lower-order effects. A reduction in the number of tests performed is achieved by prescreening gene combinations with a goodness-of-fit chi2 statistic that depends on association among candidate genes in the pooled case-control group. Multiple testing is accounted for by controlling false-discovery rates. Simulation analysis demonstrated that the FITF approach is more powerful than marginal tests of candidate genes. FITF also outperformed multifactor dimensionality reduction when interactions involved additive, dominant, or recessive genes. In an application to asthma case-control data from the Children's Health Study, FITF identified a significant multilocus effect between the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) reduced:quinone oxidoreductase gene (NQO1), myeloperoxidase gene (MPO), and catalase gene (CAT) (unadjusted P = .00026), three genes that are involved in the oxidative stress pathway. In an independent data set consisting primarily of African American and Asian American children, these three genes also showed a significant association with asthma status (P = .0008).},

abstract = {Red meat and processed meat intake is associated with a risk of colorectal cancer, a major cause of death in affluent countries. Epidemiological and experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that heme iron present in meat promotes colorectal cancer. This meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies of colon cancer reporting heme intake included 566,607 individuals and 4,734 cases of colon cancer. The relative risk of colon cancer was 1.18 (95{\%} CI: 1.06-1.32) for subjects in the highest category of heme iron intake compared with those in the lowest category. Epidemiological data thus show a suggestive association between dietary heme and risk of colon cancer. The analysis of experimental studies in rats with chemically-induced colon cancer showed that dietary hemoglobin and red meat consistently promote aberrant crypt foci, a putative precancer lesion. The mechanism is not known, but heme iron has a catalytic effect on (i) the endogenous formation of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds and (ii) the formation of cytotoxic and genotoxic aldehydes by lipoperoxidation. A review of evidence supporting these hypotheses suggests that both pathways are involved in heme iron toxicity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The accuracy and completeness of the SEER-Medicare data for measuring cancer-related therapy have not been extensively evaluated. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the best method for measuring cancer-related surgery among patients in the SEER-Medicare database. SUBJECTS: A total of 149,970 incident cases of breast, colorectal, endometrial, lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancer diagnosed between 1991 and 1993.MEASURES The most invasive surgical procedure identified through Medicare's inpatient, physician, and hospital outpatient claims was compared with corresponding data from the SEER files. RESULTS: Agreement between the SEER and Medicare files was generally highest for resection and radical surgery (eg, kappa 0.70-0.90). While there was less agreement regarding no surgical therapy and biopsy individually, the concordance of the two sources in excluding cancer-directed surgery was high. Compared with inpatient data alone, using the combined inpatient, physician, and outpatient data increased concordance between SEER and Medicare for less invasive procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The agreement of SEER and Medicare data appears to be good for major surgical procedures and for excluding persons who did not undergo cancer-directed surgery. Both the SEER and the Medicare data captured a small number of surgeries not reported in the other file. Therefore, where possible, using both data sources will enhance identification of surgeries. Because the analysis was performed with linked data, the accuracy of surgical claims in Medicare data alone cannot be assessed.},

abstract = {Microsatellite instability (MSI) occurs in 10{\%} to 20{\%} of colorectal cancers (CRC) and has been attributed to both MLH1 promoter hypermethylation and germline mutation in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. We present results from a large population- and clinic-based study of MLH1 methylation, immunohistochemistry, and MMR germline mutations that enabled us to (a) estimate the prevalence of MMR germline mutations and MLH1 methylation among MSI-H cases and help us understand if all MSI-H CRC is explained by these mechanisms and (b) estimate the associations between MLH1 methylation and sex, age, and tumor location within the colon. MLH1 methylation was measured in 1,061 population-based and 172 clinic-based cases of CRC. Overall, we observed MLH1 methylation in 60{\%} of population-based MSI-H cases and in 13{\%} of clinic-based MSI-H cases. Within the population-based cases with MMR mutation screening and conclusive immunohistochemistry results, we identified a molecular event in MMR in 91{\%} of MSI-H cases: 54{\%} had MLH1 methylation, 14{\%} had a germline mutation in a MMR gene, and 23{\%} had immunohistochemistry evidence for loss of a MMR protein. We observed a striking age difference, with the prevalence of a MMR germline mutation more than 4-fold lower and the prevalence of MLH1 methylation more than 4-fold higher in cases diagnosed after the age of 50 years than in cases diagnosed before that age. We also determined that female sex is an independent predictor of MLH1 methylation within the MSI-H subgroup. These results reinforce the importance of distinguishing between the underlying causes of MSI in studies of etiology and prognosis.},

Candidate gene studies have suggested that genotype-by-sex interaction effects on asthma risk exist, but this has not yet been explored at a genome-wide level. We aimed to identify sex-specific asthma risk alleles by performing a genome-wide scan for genotype-by-sex interactions in the ethnically diverse participants in the EVE Asthma Genetics Consortium. We performed male- and female-specific genome-wide association studies in 2653 male asthma cases, 2566 female asthma cases and 3830 non-asthma controls from European American, African American, African Caribbean and Latino populations. Association tests were conducted in each study sample, and the results were combined in ancestry-specific and cross-ancestry meta-analyses. Six sex-specific asthma risk loci had P-values {\textless} 1 × 10(-6), of which two were male specific and four were female specific; all were ancestry specific. The most significant sex-specific association in European Americans was at the interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) locus on 5q31.1. We also identify a Latino female-specific association in RAP1GAP2. Both of these loci included single-nucleotide polymorphisms that are known expression quantitative trait loci and have been associated with asthma in independent studies. The IRF1 locus is a strong candidate region for male-specific asthma susceptibility due to the association and validation we demonstrate here, the known role of IRF1 in asthma-relevant immune pathways and prior reports of sex-specific differences in interferon responses.},

abstract = {Aberrant activation of intracellular signalling pathways confers malignant properties on cancer cells. Targeting intracellular signalling pathways has been a productive strategy for drug development, with several drugs acting on signalling pathways already in use and more continually being developed. The JAK/STAT signalling pathway provides an example of this paradigm in haematological malignancies, with the identification of JAK2 mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms leading to the development of specific clinically effective JAK2 inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib. It is now clear that many solid tumours also show activation of JAK/STAT signalling. In this review, we focus on the role of JAK/STAT signalling in solid tumours, examining the molecular mechanisms that cause inappropriate pathway activation and their cellular consequences. We also discuss the degree to which activated JAK/STAT signalling contributes to oncogenesis. Studies showing the effect of activation of JAK/STAT signalling upon prognosis in several tumour types are summarised. Finally, we discuss the prospects for treating solid tumours using strategies targeting JAK/STAT signalling, including what can be learned from haematological malignancies and the extent to which results in solid tumours might be expected to differ.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication 7 July 2015; doi:10.1038/bjc.2015.233 www.bjcancer.com.},

In contrast, cervical cancer incidence increases with increasing percentage of Hispanics at the census tract. Methods— In this study, we investigate the hypothesis that Hispanics living in census tracts with high percentages of Hispanics are diagnosed with more advanced cancer, with respect to tumor size and stage of diagnosis. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry and the U.S. Census Bureau were used to estimate the odds of diagnosis at a “late” stage (II, III, IV) versus “early” stage (I) and breast cancer tumor size among Hispanics as a function of census tract percent Hispanic. Hispanic ethnicity in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry was identified by medical record review and Hispanic surname lists. The study also used income of Hispanics living in the census tract and controlled for age at diagnosis and gender. Results— We found that Hispanics living in neighborhoods with higher density of Hispanic populations were more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer, and to have a larger tumor size of breast cancer. Conclusions— Our findings suggest that the benefits of lower cancer incidence in high tract percent Hispanics are partially offset by poorer access and reduced use of screening in conjunction with lower income, poorer health insurance coverage, and language barriers typical of these communities.},

We sought to use the random forest algorithm to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may be involved in gene-by-smoking interactions related to the early-onset of coronary heart disease. METHODS Using data from the Framingham Heart Study, our analysis used a case-only design in which the outcome of interest was age of onset of early coronary heart disease. RESULTS Smoking status was dichotomized as ever versus never. The single SNP with the highest importance score assigned by random forests was rs2011345. This SNP was not associated with age alone in the control subjects. Using generalized estimating equations to adjust for sex and account for familial correlation, there was evidence of an interaction between rs2011345 and smoking status. CONCLUSION The results of this analysis suggest that random forests may be a useful tool for identifying SNPs taking part in gene-by-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies.},

abstract = {One of the most consistent epidemiological associations between diet and human disease risk is the impact of red meat consumption (beef, pork, and lamb, particularly in processed forms). While risk estimates vary, associations are reported with all-cause mortality, colorectal and other carcinomas, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and possibly other inflammatory processes. There are many proposed explanations for these associations, some long discussed in the literature. Attempts to explain the effects of red meat consumption have invoked various red meat-associated agents, including saturated fat, high salt intake, Trimethylamine–N-oxide (TMAO) generation by microbiota, and environmental pollutants contaminating red meat, none of which are specific for red meat. Even the frequently mentioned polycyclic aromatic carcinogens arising from high temperature cooking methods are not red meat specific, as these are also generated by grilling poultry or fish, as well as by other forms of cooking. The traditional explanations that appear to be more red meat specific invoke the impact of N-nitroso compounds, heme iron, and the potential of heme to catalyze endogenous nitrosation. However, heme can be denatured by cooking, high levels of plasma hemopexin will block its tissue delivery, and much higher amounts of heme likely originate from red blood cell breakdown in vivo. Therefore, red meat-derived heme could only contribute to colorectal carcinoma risk, via direct local effects. Also, none of these mechanisms explain the apparent human propensity i.e., other carnivores have not been reported at high risk for all these diseases. A more recently proposed hypothesis involves infectious agents in beef from specific dairy cattle as agents of colorectal cancer. We have also described another mechanistic explanation for the human propensity for risk of red-meat associated diseases that is consistent with most observations: metabolic incorporation of a non-human sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) into the tissues of red meat consumers and the subsequent interaction with inflammation-provoking antibodies against this “xenoautoantigen”. Overall, we conclude that while multiple mechanisms are likely operative, many proposed theories to date are not specific for red meat, and that the viral and xenoautoantigen theories deserve further consideration. Importantly, there are potential non-toxic dietary antidotes, if the xenoautoantigen theory is indeed correct.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. The vast majority of CRC cases have been linked to environmental causes rather than to heritable genetic changes. Over the last decades, epidemiological evidence linking the consumption of red and, more convincingly, of processed red meat to CRC has accumulated. In parallel, hypotheses on carcinogenic mechanisms underlying an association between CRC and the intake of red and processed red meat have been proposed and investigated in biological studies. The hypotheses that have received most attention until now include (1) the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic amines, two groups of compounds recognized as carcinogenic, (2) the enhancing effect of (nitrosyl)heme on the formation of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds and lipid peroxidation. However, none of these hypotheses completely explains the link between red and processed red meat intake and the CRC risk. Consequently, scientists have proposed additional mechanisms or refined their hypotheses. This review first briefly summarizes the development of CRC followed by an in-depth overview and critical discussion of the different potential carcinogenic mechanisms underlying the increased CRC risk associated with the consumption of red and processed red meat.},

abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests that diet quality indices may serve as prognostic indicators of disease. However, the ability of these indices to predict breast cancer risk has not been evaluated previously. We assessed the association between several diet quality scores and the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The indices we used were the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), Diet Quality Index-Revised (DQI-R), Recommended Food Score (RFS), and the alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed). We calculated diet quality indices from dietary information collected in FFQ administered 5 times between 1984 and 1998 among women in the Nurses' Health Study cohort. Relative risks (RR) were computed using Cox proportional hazards models and adjusted for known risk factors for breast cancer. Separate analyses were conducted for estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) tumors. Between 1984 and 2002, we documented 3580 cases of breast cancer, of which 2367 were ER+, and 575 were ER-. We did not observe any association between the diet quality indices and total or ER+ breast cancer risk. However, for ER- breast cancer, after adjusting for potential confounders, the RR comparing highest to lowest quintiles were 0.78 (95{\%} Cl = 0.59-1.04, P for trend = 0.01) for the AHEI, 0.69 (95{\%} Cl = 0.51-0.94, P for trend = 0.003) for the RFS, and 0.79 (95{\%} Cl = 0.60-1.03, P for trend = 0.03) for the aMed. These observations appeared to be the result of an inverse association (P for trend = 0.01) with the vegetable component of the scores. We conclude that women who scored high in AHEI, RFS, and aMed had a lower risk of ER- breast cancer. The HEI and DQI-R appeared to be of limited value in predicting breast cancer risk.

Results Risk reduction was observed for oleic and palmitoleic MUFAs (OROA= 0.77, 95{\%} CI: 0.65–0.92, P = 3.9 × 10−3; ORPOA= 0.36, 95{\%} CI: 0.15–0.84, P = 0.018). PUFAs linoleic and arachidonic acid had negative and positive associations with CRC respectively (ORLA= 0.95, 95{\%} CI: 0.93–0.98, P = 3.7 × 10−4; ORAA= 1.05, 95{\%} CI: 1.02–1.07, P = 1.7 × 10−4). The SFA stearic acid was associated with increased CRC risk (ORSA= 1.17, 95{\%} CI: 1.01–1.35, P = 0.041). Conclusion Results from our analysis are broadly consistent with a pro-inflammatory FA profile having a detrimental effect in terms of CRC risk.},

abstract = {Animal work implicates chemical carcinogens, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) as contributing to the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). The epidemiologic evidence, however, remains inconsistent possibly due to intra-individual variation in bioactivation of these compounds. We conducted a case-control study of colorectal adenoma (914 cases, 1185 controls) and CRC (496 cases, 607 controls) among Japanese Americans, European Americans and Native Hawaiians to investigate the association of genetic variation in the PAH and HAA bioactivation pathway (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, AHR and ARNT) identified through sequencing with risk of colorectal neoplasia, as well as their interactions with smoking and intakes of red meat and HAAs. The A allele for ARNT rs12410394 was significantly inversely associated with CRC [odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for GG, AG and AA genotypes: 1.00, 0.66 (0.48-0.89), 0.54 (0.37-0.78), P(trend) = 0.0008] after multiple comparison adjustment. CYP1A2 rs11072508 was marginally significantly associated with CRC, where each copy of the T allele was associated with reduced risk (OR: 0.72, 95{\%} CI: 0.58-0.88, P(trend) = 0.0017). No heterogeneity of genetic effects across racial/ethnic groups was detected. In addition, no significant interaction was observed after adjusting for multiple testing between genetic variants and pack-years of smoking, intake of red meat or HAAs (PhIP, MeIQx, Di-MeIQx or total HAAs) or NAT2 genotype (Rapid versus Slow or Intermediate). This study suggests that the genomic region around ARNT rs12410394 may harbor variants associated with CRC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Healthy post-pregnancy outcomes are contingent upon an informed regimen of prenatal care encouraging healthy maternal consumption habits. In this article, we describe aspects of maternal intake of food, drink, and medication in a population of predominantly Hispanic women in Southern California. Potential implications for unhealthy prenatal dietary choices are discussed. METHODS The Food, Beverage, and Medication Intake Questionnaire (FBMIQ) measures common practices of maternal consumption during pregnancy. The FBMIQ was administered to English and Spanish speaking pregnant and recently pregnant (36 weeks pregnant - 8 weeks post-partum) women over the age of 18 who were receiving care from a private medical group in Downey CA. RESULTS A total of 200 women completed the FBMIQ. Consumption habits of healthy foods and beverages, unhealthy foods, unhealthy beverages, and medication are characterized in this article. Data indicate widespread consumption of fresh fruit, meats, milk and juice and indicate most women used prenatal vitamin supplements. Studies in developmental neuroscience have shown that certain substances may cause teratogenic effects on the fetus when ingested by the mother during pregnancy. Those potentially harmful substances included in our study were Bisphenol-A (BPA), methylmercury, caffeine, alcohol and certain medications. Our results show that a proportion of the women surveyed in our study consumed BPA, methylmercury, caffeine, alcohol, and certain medications at varied levels during pregnancy. This represents an interesting finding and suggests a disconnect between scientific data and general recommendations provided to pregnant mothers by obstetricians. CONCLUSIONS The results of our study demonstrate that a proportion of pregnant women consume substances that are potentially teratogenic and may impact the health and well being of the offspring. It is important to appraise healthy and unhealthy consumption habits in order to encourage healthy practices and alleviate future effects of preventable, toxin-induced developmental issues. Prenatal advising should discourage the consumption of dangerous foods, beverages, and medications that women commonly report eating during pregnancy.},

abstract = {Standard prospective logistic regression analysis of case-control data often leads to very imprecise estimates of gene-environment interactions due to small numbers of cases or controls in cells of crossing genotype and exposure. In contrast, under the assumption of gene-environment independence, modern "retrospective" methods, including the "case-only" approach, can estimate the interaction parameters much more precisely, but they can be seriously biased when the underlying assumption of gene-environment independence is violated. In this article, we propose a novel empirical Bayes-type shrinkage estimator to analyze case-control data that can relax the gene-environment independence assumption in a data-adaptive fashion. In the special case, involving a binary gene and a binary exposure, the method leads to an estimator of the interaction log odds ratio parameter in a simple closed form that corresponds to an weighted average of the standard case-only and case-control estimators. We also describe a general approach for deriving the new shrinkage estimator and its variance within the retrospective maximum-likelihood framework developed by Chatterjee and Carroll (2005, Biometrika92, 399-418). Both simulated and real data examples suggest that the proposed estimator strikes a balance between bias and efficiency depending on the true nature of the gene-environment association and the sample size for a given study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The level of evidence regarding the association between red and processed meat intakes and breast cancer risk is still low, due to insufficient prospective studies. Moreover, mechanistic data suggest that some antioxidants may modulate this relationship but epidemiological evidence is lacking. Our objectives were to investigate relationships between red and processed meat intakes and breast cancer risk, and to study whether an antioxidant supplementation modulates these associations, which, to our knowledge, has never been investigated before. METHODS The SU.VI.MAX study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which participants received a combination of low-dose antioxidants or a placebo from 1994 to 2002. This observational prospective analysis included 4684 women among whom 190 developed a first incident breast cancer between 1994 and 2007 [mean (range) follow-up=11.3 (0-13)years]. Baseline dietary data were assessed by repeated dietary records in 1994-1995. Associations between quartiles of red and processed meat intakes and breast cancer risk were characterized by multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS Breast cancer risk was directly associated with processed meat intake [hazard ratio (HR)Q4vsQ1=1.45 (0.92-2.27), Ptrend=0.03] and this association was stronger when excluding cooked ham [HRQ4vsQ1=1.90 (1.18-3.05), Ptrend=0.005]. In stratified analyses, processed meat intake was directly associated with breast cancer risk in the placebo group only [HRQ4vsQ1=2.46 (1.28-4.72), Ptrend=0.001], but not in the supplemented group [HRQ4vsQ1=0.86 (0.45-1.63), Ptrend=0.7]. CONCLUSION Processed meat intake was prospectively associated with increased breast cancer risk. This study also suggests that antioxidants may modulate this association by counteracting the potential pro-carcinogenic effects of processed meat on breast cancer.},

If the primary purpose of the study is to estimate the effect of gene-environment interaction in disease etiology, one can do so without employing controls. The case-only design has been promoted as an efficient and valid method for screening for gene-environment interaction. The authors derive a method for estimating sample size requirements, present sample size estimates, and compare minimum sample size requirements to detect gene-environment interaction in case-only studies with case-control studies. Assuming independence between exposure and genotype in the population, the authors believe that the case-only design is more efficient than a case-control design in detecting gene-environment interaction. They also illustrate a method to estimate sample size when information on marginal effects (relative risk) of exposure and genotype is available from previous studies.},

Here, we introduce a method that leverages polygenic functional enrichment to incorporate coding, conserved, regulatory and LD-related genomic annotations into association analyses. We show via simulations with real genotypes that the method, Functionally Informed Novel Discovery Of Risk loci (FINDOR), correctly controls the false-positive rate at null loci and attains a 9-38{\%} increase in the number of independent associations detected at causal loci, depending on trait polygenicity and sample size. We applied FINDOR to 27 independent complex traits and diseases from the interim UK Biobank release (average N=130K). Averaged across traits, we attained a 13{\%} increase in genome-wide significant loci detected (including a 20{\%} increase for disease traits) compared to unweighted raw p-values that do not use functional data. We replicated the novel loci in independent UK Biobank and non-UK Biobank data, yielding a highly statistically significant replication slope (0.66-0.69) in each case. Finally, we applied FINDOR to the full UK Biobank release (average N=416K), attaining smaller relative improvements (consistent with simulations) but larger absolute improvements, detecting an additional 583 GWAS loci. In conclusion, leveraging functional enrichment using our method robustly increases GWAS power.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dairy intake may increase prostate cancer risk, but whether this is due to calcium's suppression of circulating vitamin D remains unclear. Findings on calcium and vitamin D intake and prostate cancer are inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: We examined the association of dairy, calcium, and vitamin D intake with prostate cancer. DESIGN: In a prospective study of 3612 men followed from 1982-1984 to 1992 for the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Epidemiologic Follow-up Study, 131 prostate cancer cases were identified. Dietary intake was estimated from questionnaires completed in 1982-1984. Relative risk (RR) and 95{\%} CIs were estimated by using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, race, and other covariates. RESULTS: Compared with men in the lowest tertile for dairy food intake, men in the highest tertile had a relative risk (RR) of 2.2 (95{\%} CI: 1.2, 3.9; trend P = 0.05). Low-fat milk was associated with increased risk (RR = 1.5; 95{\%} CI: 1.1, 2.2; third compared with first tertile; trend P = 0.02), but whole milk was not (RR = 0.8; 95{\%} CI: 0.5, 1.3; third compared with first tertile; trend P = 0.35). Dietary calcium was also strongly associated with increased risk (RR = 2.2; 95{\%} CI: 1.4, 3.5; third compared with first tertile; trend P = 0.001). After adjustment for calcium intake, neither vitamin D nor phosphorus was clearly associated with risk. CONCLUSIONS: Dairy consumption may increase prostate cancer risk through a calcium-related pathway. Calcium and low-fat milk have been promoted to reduce risk of osteoporosis and colon cancer. Therefore, the mechanisms by which dairy and calcium might increase prostate cancer risk should be clarified and confirmed.},

We evaluated genetic variation in BMP-related genes and breast cancer risk among Hispanic (2,111 cases, 2,597 controls) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) (1,481 cases, 1,586 controls) women who participated in the 4-Corner's Breast Cancer Study, the Mexico Breast Cancer Study and the San Francisco Bay Area Breast Cancer Study. BMP genes and their receptors evaluated include ACVR1, AVCR2A, ACVR2B, ACVRL1, BMP1, BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, BMP7, BMPR1A, BMPR1B, BMPR2, MSTN and GDF10. Additionally, 104 ancestral informative markers were assessed to discriminate between European and native American ancestry. The importance of estrogen on BMP-related associations was suggested through unique associations by menopausal status and estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor status of tumors. After adjustment for multiple comparisons ACVR1 (8 SNPs) was modestly associated with ER+PR+ tumors [odds ratios (ORs) between 1.18 and 1.39 padj {\textless} 0.05]. ACVR1 (3 SNPs) and BMP4 (3 SNPs) were associated with ER+PR- tumors (ORs 0.59-2.07; padj {\textless} 0.05). BMPR2 was associated with ER-PR+ tumors (OR 4.20; 95{\%} CI 1.62, 10.91; padj {\textless} 0.05) as was GDF10 (2 SNPs; ORs 3.62 and 3.85; padj {\textless} 0.05).

Differences in association also were observed by percentage of native ancestry and menopausal status.

abstract = {BACKGROUND We modelled the utility of applying a personalised screening approach for colorectal cancer (CRC) when compared with standard age-based screening. In this personalised screening approach, eligibility is determined by absolute risk which is calculated from age and polygenic risk score (PRS), where the PRS is relative risk attributable to common genetic variation. In contrast, eligibility in age-based screening is determined only by age. DESIGN We calculated absolute risks of CRC from UK population age structure, incidence and mortality rate data, and a PRS distribution which we derived for the 37 known CRC susceptibility variants. We compared the number of CRC cases potentially detectable by personalised and age-based screening. Using Genome-Wide Complex Trait Analysis to calculate the heritability attributable to common variation, we repeated the analysis assuming all common CRC risk variants were known. RESULTS Based on the known CRC variants, individuals with a PRS in the top 1{\%} have a 2.9-fold increased CRC risk over the population median. Compared with age-based screening (aged 60: 10-year absolute risk 1.96{\%} in men, 1.19{\%} in women, as per the UK NHS National Bowel Screening Programme), personalised screening of individuals aged 55-69 at the same risk would lead to 16{\%} fewer men and 17{\%} fewer women being eligible for screening with 10{\%} and 8{\%}, respectively, fewer screen-detected cases. If all susceptibility variants were known, individuals with a PRS in the top 1{\%} would have an estimated 7.7-fold increased risk. Personalised screening would then result in 26{\%} fewer men and women being eligible for screening with 7{\%} and 5{\%} fewer screen-detected cases. CONCLUSION Personalised screening using PRS has the potential to optimise population screening for CRC and to define those likely to maximally benefit from chemoprevention. There are however significant technical and operational details to be addressed before any such programme is introduced.},

abstract = {Differences in breast cancer incidence among young women aged 20–49 years by stage and tumor characteristics, age, race, and ethnicity, 2004–2013 Abstract Purpose Younger women diagnosed with breast cancer have poorer prognoses and higher mortality compared to older women. Young black women have higher incidence rates of breast cancer and more aggressive subtypes than women of other races/ethnicities. In this study, we examined recent trends and variations in breast cancer incidence among young women in the United States. Methods Using 2004–2013 National Program of Cancer Registries and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Pro-gram data, we calculated breast cancer incidence rates and trends and examined variations in stage, grade, and tumor subtype by age and race/ethnicity among young women aged 20–49 years. Results The majority of breast cancer cases occurred in women aged 40–44 and 45–49 years (77.3{\%}). Among women aged {\textless} 45 years, breast cancer incidence was highest among black women. Incidence trends increased from 2004 to 2013 for Asian or Pacific Islander (API) women and white women aged 20–34 years. Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Hispanic women had higher proportions of cases diagnosed at later stages than white and API women. Black women had a higher proportion of grade III–IV tumors than other racial/ethnic groups. Across all age groups, incidence rates for triple-negative breast cancer were significantly higher in black women than women of other races/ethnicities, and this dis-parity increased with age. Conclusions Breast cancer among young women is a highly heterogeneous disease. Differences in tumor characteristics by age and race/ethnicity suggest opportunities for further research into personal and cultural factors that may influence breast cancer risk among younger women.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a leading cause of mortality in US men and the prevalence continues to rise world-wide especially in countries where men consume a 'Western-style' diet. Epidemiologic, preclinical and clinical studies suggest a potential role for dietary intake on the incidence and progression of PCa. 'This minireview provides an overview of recent published literature with regard to nutrients, dietary factors, dietary patterns and PCa incidence and progression. Low carbohydrates intake, soy protein, omega-3 (w-3) fat, green teas, tomatoes and tomato products and zyflamend showed promise in reducing PCa risk or progression. A higher saturated fat intake and a higher $\beta$-carotene status may increase risk. A 'U' shape relationship may exist between folate, vitamin C, vitamin D and calcium with PCa risk. Despite the inconsistent and inconclusive findings, the potential for a role of dietary intake for the prevention and treatment of PCa is promising. The combination of all the beneficial factors for PCa risk reduction in a healthy dietary pattern may be the best dietary advice. This pattern includes rich fruits and vegetables, reduced refined carbohydrates, total and saturated fats, and reduced cooked meats. Further carefully designed prospective trials are warranted.},

abstract = {Genotype imputation methods have become increasingly popular for recovering untyped genotype data. An important application with imputed genotypes is to test genetic association for diseases. Imputation-based association test can provide additional insight beyond what is provided by testing on typed tagging SNPs only. A variety of effective imputation-based association tests have been proposed. However, their performances are affected by a variety of genetic factors, which have not been well studied. In this study, using both simulated and real data sets, we investigated the effects of LD, MAF of untyped causal SNP and imputation accuracy rate on the performances of seven popular imputation-based association methods, including MACH2qtl/dat, SNPTEST, ProbABEL, Beagle, Plink, BIMBAM and SNPMStat. We also aimed to provide a comprehensive comparison among methods. Results show that: 1). imputation-based association tests can boost signals and improve power under medium and high LD levels, with the power improvement increasing with strengthening LD level; 2) the power increases with higher MAF of untyped causal SNPs under medium to high LD level; 3). under low LD level, a high imputation accuracy rate cannot guarantee an improvement of power; 4). among methods, MACH2qtl/dat, ProbABEL and SNPTEST perform similarly and they consistently outperform other methods. Our results are helpful in guiding the choice of imputation-based association test in practical application.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Transcription factors and nuclear receptors constitute a link between exposure to heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from meat and tobacco smoke and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. The aim of this study was to investigate if polymorphisms in nuclear factor kappa-B, pregnane X receptor, and liver X receptor were associated with risk of CRC, and to investigate possible interactions with lifestyle factors such as smoking, meat consumption, and NSAID use. METHODS The polymorphisms nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkB, NFKB1) -94 insertion/deletion ATTG (rs28362491), pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) A-24381C (rs1523127), C8055T (rs2276707), A7635G (rs6785049), liver X receptor (LXR-$\beta$, NR1H3) C-rs1405655T, T-rs2695121C were assessed together with lifestyle factors in a nested case-cohort study of 378 CRC cases and 756 random participants from the Danish prospective Diet, Cancer and Health study of 57,053 persons. RESULTS Carriers of NFkB -94deletion were at 1.45-fold higher risk of CRC than homozygous carriers of the insertion allele (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.45, 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI): 1.10-1.92). There was interaction between this polymorphism and intake of red and processed meat in relation to CRC risk. Carriers of NFkB -94deletion were at 3{\%} increased risk pr 25 gram meat per day (95{\%} CI: 0.98-1.09) whereas homozygous carriers of the insertion were not at increased risk (p for interaction = 0.03). PXR and LXR polymorphisms were not associated with CRC risk. There was no interaction between use of nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) or smoking status and NFkB, PXR or LXR polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS A polymorphism in NFkB was associated with CRC risk and there was interaction between this polymorphism and meat intake in relation to CRC risk. This study suggests a role for NFkB in CRC aetiology.},

Pertinent prospective cohort studies were identified by a search of Embase and PubMed from inception to September 2015. Study-specific relative risks (RRs) with 95{\%} confidence intervals were pooled using a random-effect model. Between-study heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed, and sensitivity analysis was conducted. Twenty-four independent studies on dietary total fat and fatty acids intake and seven studies on serum fatty acids were included. The pooled RR of breast cancer for the highest vs. lowest category of dietary total fat intake was 1.10 (1.02-1.19); however, no association was observed in studies adjusting for traditional risk factors of breast cancer. No association was observed between animal fat, vegetable fat, saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), n-3 PUFA, n-6 PUFA, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid and risk of breast cancer. The pooled RRs of breast cancer for the highest vs. lowest category of serum SFA, MUFA, PUFA, n-3 PUFA and n-6 PUFA were 1.00 (0.78-1.28), 1.41 (0.99-2.03), 0.59 (0.27-1.30), 0.81 (0.60-1.10) and 0.84 (0.60-1.18), respectively. Results from this meta-analysis suggested that dietary total fat and fatty acids might be not associated with risk of breast cancer.},

abstract = {The role of N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) polymorphism in breast cancer is still unclear. We explored the associations between potential sources of exposure to aromatic and heterocyclic amines (AHA), acetylation status and receptor-defined breast cancer in 1020 incident cases and 1047 population controls of the German GENICA study. Acetylation status was assessed as slow or fast. Therefore, NAT2 haplotypes were estimated using genotype information from six NAT2 polymorphisms. Most probable haplotypes served as alleles for the deduction of NAT2 acetylation status. The risks of developing estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive or negative tumors were estimated for tobacco smoking, consumption of red meat, grilled food, coffee, and tea, as well as expert-rated occupational exposure to AHA with logistic regression conditional on age and adjusted for potential confounders. Joint effects of these factors and NAT2 acetylation status were investigated. Frequent consumption of grilled food and coffee showed higher risks in slow acetylators for receptor-negative tumors [grilled food: ER-: odds ratio (OR) 2.57, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.07-6.14 for regular vs. rare; coffee: ER-: OR 2.55, 95{\%} CI 1.22-5.33 for {\textgreater}or=4 vs. 0 cups/day]. We observed slightly higher risks for never smokers that are fast acetylators for receptor-positive tumors compared with slow acetylators (ER-: OR 1.32, 95{\%} CI 1.00-1.73). Our results support differing risk patterns for receptor-defined breast cancer. However, the modifying role of NAT2 for receptor-defined breast cancer is difficult to interpret in the light of complex mixtures of exposure to AHA.},

abstract = {Meat intake is associated with the risk of colorectal cancer. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate interactions between meat intake and genetic variation in order to identify biological pathways involved in meat carcinogenesis. We performed a literature search of PubMed and Embase using "interaction", "meat", "polymorphisms", and "colorectal cancer", and data on meat-gene interactions were extracted. The studies were divided according to whether information on meat intake was collected prospectively or retrospectively. In prospective studies, interactions between meat intake and polymorphisms in PTGS2 (encoding COX-2), ABCB1, IL10, NFKB1, MSH3, XPC (Pint = 0.006, 0.01, 0.04, 0.03, 0.002, 0.01, respectively), but not IL1B, HMOX1, ABCC2, ABCG2, NR1I2 (encoding PXR), NR1H2 (encoding LXR), NAT1, NAT2, MSH6, or MLH1 in relation to CRC were found. Interaction between a polymorphism in XPC and meat was found in one prospective and one case-control study; however, the directions of the risk estimates were opposite. Thus, none of the findings were replicated. The results from this systematic review suggest that genetic variation in the inflammatory response and DNA repair pathway is involved in meat-related colorectal carcinogenesis, whereas no support for the involvement of heme and iron from meat or cooking mutagens was found. Further studies assessing interactions between meat intake and genetic variation in relation to CRC in large well-characterised prospective cohorts with relevant meat exposure are warranted., Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014, The Author(s).},

abstract = {Risk factors for prostate cancer could differ for various sub-groups, such as for "aggressive" and "non-aggressive" cancers or by grade or stage. Determinants of mortality could differ from those for incidence. Using data from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, we re-examined 10 factors (cigarette smoking history, physical activity, BMI, family history of prostate cancer, race, height, total energy consumption, and intakes of calcium, tomato sauce and alpha-linolenic acid) using multivariable Cox regression in relation to multiple subcategories for prostate cancer risk. These were factors that we previously found to be predictors of prostate cancer incidence or advanced prostate cancer in this cohort, and that have some support in the literature. In this analysis, only 4 factors had a clear statistically significant association with overall incident prostate cancer: African-American race, positive family history, higher tomato sauce intake (inversely) and alpha-linolenic acid intake. In contrast, for fatal prostate cancer, recent smoking history, taller height, higher BMI, family history, and high intakes of total energy, calcium and alpha-linolenic acid were associated with a statistically significant increased risk. Higher vigorous physical activity level was associated with lower risk. In relation to these risk factors, advanced stage at diagnosis was a good surrogate for fatal prostate cancer, but high-grade (Gleason {\textgreater}/= 7 or Gleason {\textgreater}/= 8) was not. Only for high calcium intake was there a close correspondence for associations among high-grade cancer, advanced and fatal prostate cancer. Tomato sauce (inversely) and alpha-linolenic acid (positively) intakes were strong predictors of advanced cancer among those with low-grade cancers at diagnosis. Although the proportion of advanced stage cancers was much lower after PSA screening began, risk factors for advanced stage prostate cancers were similar in the pre-PSA and PSA era. The complexity of the clinical and pathologic manifestations of prostate cancer must be considered in the design and interpretation of studies.},

Complex historical factors have resulted in varying proportions of ancestral contributions between individuals within and among ethnic groups. We developed a panel of 446 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) optimized to estimate ancestral proportions in individuals and populations throughout Latin America. We used genome-wide data from 953 individuals from diverse African, European, and Native American populations to select AIMs optimized for each of the three main continental populations that form the basis of modern Latin American populations. We selected markers on the basis of locus-specific branch length to be informative, well distributed throughout the genome, capable of being genotyped on widely available commercial platforms, and applicable throughout the Americas by minimizing within-continent heterogeneity. We then validated the panel in samples from four admixed populations by comparing ancestry estimates based on the AIMs panel to estimates based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. The panel provided balanced discriminatory power among the three ancestral populations and accurate estimates of individual ancestry proportions (R² {\textgreater} 0.9 for ancestral components with significant between-subject variance). Finally, we genotyped samples from 18 populations from Latin America using the AIMs panel and estimated variability in ancestry within and between these populations. This panel and its reference genotype information will be useful resources to explore population history of admixture in Latin America and to correct for the potential effects of population stratification in admixed samples in the region.},

abstract = {The assessment of treatment effects from observational studies may be biased with patients not randomly allocated to the experimental or control group. One way to overcome this conceptual shortcoming in the design of such studies is the use of propensity scores to adjust for differences of the characteristics between patients treated with experimental and control interventions. The propensity score is defined as the probability that a patient received the experimental intervention conditional on pre-treatment characteristics at baseline. Here, we review how propensity scores are estimated and how they can help in adjusting the treatment effect for baseline imbalances. We further discuss how to evaluate adequate overlap of baseline characteristics between patient groups, provide guidelines for variable selection and model building in modelling the propensity score, and review different methods of propensity score adjustments. We conclude that propensity analyses may help in evaluating the comparability of patients in observational studies, and may account for more potential confounding factors than conventional covariate adjustment approaches. However, bias due to unmeasured confounding cannot be corrected for.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is strong evidence that high meat intake increases the risk of colorectal cancer. However, for other cancer sites there is currently less convincing evidence. METHODS: To further explore associations between meat intake and cancer risk we conducted a multisite case-control study of 11 cancer sites in Uruguay between 1996 and 2004, including 3,539 cancer cases and 2,032 hospital controls. We used unconditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals of cancer associated with meat intake. RESULTS: In the multivariable model there was a significant increase in the odds of cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (OR= 3.65, 95{\%} CI: 2.21-6.01), esophagus (OR= 3.36, 95{\%} CI: 1.97-5.72), larynx (OR=2.91, 95{\%} CI: 1.80-4.68), stomach (OR= 2.19, 95{\%} CI: 1.31-3.65), colorectum (OR= 3.83, 95{\%} CI: 2.37-6.20), lung (OR= 2.17, 95{\%} CI: 1.52-3.10), breast (OR= 1.97, 95{\%} CI: 1.04-3.75), prostate (OR= 1.87, 95{\%} CI: 1.08-3.21), bladder (OR= 2.11, 95{\%} CI: 1.20-3.72) and kidney (OR= 2.72, 95{\%} CI: 1.22-6.07) with high intake of red meat and similar findings were found for total meat. In addition, intake of beef and lamb were also associated with increased risk of several cancer sites. High intake of processed meat was associated with increased risk of cancers of the esophagus (OR= 1.63, 95{\%} CI: 1.08-2.47), larynx (OR= 1.84, 95{\%} CI: 1.21-2.78), stomach (OR= 1.62, 95{\%} CI: 1.07-2.44), colorectum (OR= 2.15, 95{\%} CI: 1.49-3.11), lung (OR= 1.70, 95{\%} CI: 1.28-2.25) and breast (OR= 1.53, 95{\%} CI: 1.01-2.30). CONCLUSION: Our results confirm earlier findings of increased risk of digestive tract cancers, but suggest that meat consumption also increases the risk of several other cancers.},

abstract = {Cumulative evidence suggests a possible interaction of cooking methods with diet in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Studies, however, are few and inconsistent. We evaluated the association of animal food intake and degree of browning by deep-frying with breast cancer risk in a population-based case-control study conducted during 1996-1998 among Chinese women in Shanghai, a population with a traditionally low risk of breast cancer. Included in the study were 1459 cases and 1556 age-frequency-matched controls with response rates of 91.1 and 90.3{\%}, respectively. A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to obtain information on usual intake of animal foods and cooking oils and usual cooking methods. Increasing intake of red meat and freshwater fish was related to a moderately elevated risk of breast cancer risk. Stratified analyses showed that the positive association with red meat intake was primarily restricted to those who used deep-frying cooking method, particularly among those who deep-fried foods to well-done (odds ratio, 1.92; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.30-2.83 for the highest versus the lowest quintile; P for trend, 0.002). On the other hand, high intake of nonhydrogenated soybean cooking oil was related to a reduced risk of breast cancer among women who never deep-fried animal foods (odds ratio, 0.48; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.28-0.82 for the highest versus the lowest quintile; P for trend, 0.02). The positive association of breast cancer risk with red meat intake, especially well-done red meat, was more pronounced among women with a high body mass index than those without this risk factor, and the test for multiplicative interaction was statistically significant. This study suggests that high intake of deep-fried, well-done red meat may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, and the positive association may be modified by body weight. This study also suggests that nonhydrogenated soybean oil, if not used in high-temperature cooking, may be associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than a dozen loci associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Here, we examined potential effect-modification between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at 10 of these loci and probable or established environmental risk factors for CRC in 7,016 CRC cases and 9,723 controls from nine cohort and case-control studies. We used meta-analysis of an efficient empirical-Bayes estimator to detect potential multiplicative interactions between each of the SNPs [rs16892766 at 8q23.3 (EIF3H/UTP23), rs6983267 at 8q24 (MYC), rs10795668 at 10p14 (FLJ3802842), rs3802842 at 11q23 (LOC120376), rs4444235 at 14q22.2 (BMP4), rs4779584 at 15q13 (GREM1), rs9929218 at 16q22.1 (CDH1), rs4939827 at 18q21 (SMAD7), rs10411210 at 19q13.1 (RHPN2), and rs961253 at 20p12.3 (BMP2)] and select major CRC risk factors (sex, body mass index, height, smoking status, aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, alcohol use, and dietary intake of calcium, folate, red meat, processed meat, vegetables, fruit, and fiber). The strongest statistical evidence for a gene-environment interaction across studies was for vegetable consumption and rs16892766, located on chromosome 8q23.3, near the EIF3H and UTP23 genes (nominal P(interaction) = 1.3 × 10(-4); adjusted P = 0.02). The magnitude of the main effect of the SNP increased with increasing levels of vegetable consumption. No other interactions were statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Overall, the association of most CRC susceptibility loci identified in initial GWAS seems to be invariant to the other risk factors considered; however, our results suggest potential modification of the rs16892766 effect by vegetable consumption.},

Unaffected sisters of the cases served as matched controls (222 total). Dietary intake were assessed with a food frequency questionnaire. Total fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, oleic acid, and linoleic acid intake was inversely associated with premenopausal bilateral breast cancer risk. Consumption of carbohydrates (and sweetened beverages) was associated with an increased risk. We observed no associations for dietary fiber, antioxidants, or major food groupings, but we did observe inverse associations for intake of low fat dairy products and tofu.

A central question in this enterprise is whether to obtain summary results or individual participant data from relevant studies. We show theoretically and numerically that meta-analysis of summary results is statistically as efficient as joint analysis of individual participant data (provided that both analyses are performed properly under the same modeling assumptions). We illustrate this equivalence with case-control data from the Finland-United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics (FUSION) study. Collating only summary results will increase the number and representativeness of available studies, simplify data collection and analysis, reduce resource utilization, and accelerate discovery.},

abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitously distributed environmental chemicals. PAHs acquire carcinogenicity only after they have been activated by xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes to highly reactive metabolites capable of attacking cellular DNA. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are central to the metabolic activation of these PAHs to epoxide intermediates, which are converted with the aid of epoxide hydrolase to the ultimate carcinogens, diol-epoxides. Historically, CYP1A1 was believed to be the only enzyme that catalyzes activation of these procarcinogenic PAHs. However, recent studies have established that CYP1B1, a newly identified member of the CYP1 family, plays a very important role in the metabolic activation of PAHs. In CYP1B1 gene-knockout mice treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, decreased rates of tumor formation were observed, when compared to wild-type mice. Significantly, gene expression of CYP1A1 and 1B1 is induced by PAHs and polyhalogenated hydrocarbons such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin through the arylhydrocarbon receptor. Differences in the susceptibility of individuals to the adverse action of PAHs may, in part, be due to differences in the levels of expression of CYP1A1 and 1B1 and to genetic variations in the CYP1A1 and 1B1 genes.},

abstract = {Including previously genotyped controls in a genome-wide association study can provide cost-savings, but can also create design biases. When cases and controls are genotyped on different platforms, the imputation needed to provide genome-wide coverage will introduce differential measurement error and may lead to false positives. We compared genotype frequencies of two healthy control groups from the Nurses' Health Study genotyped on different platforms [Affymetrix 6.0 (n = 1,672) and Illumina HumanHap550 (n = 1,038)]. Using standard imputation quality filters, we observed 9,841 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) out of 2,347,809 (0.4{\%}) significant at the 5 × 10(-8) level. We explored three methods for controlling for this Type I error inflation. One method was to remove platform effects using principal components; another was to restrict to SNPs of highest quality imputation; and a third was to genotype some controls alongside cases to exclude SNPs that are statistical artifact. The first method could not reduce the Type I error rate; the other two could dramatically reduce the error rate, although both required that a portion of SNPs be excluded from analysis. Ideally, the biases we describe would be eliminated at the design stage, by genotyping sufficient numbers of cases and controls on each platform. Researchers using imputation to combine samples genotyped on different platforms with severely unbalanced case-control ratios should be aware of the potential for inflated Type I error rates and apply appropriate quality filters. Every SNP found with genome-wide significance should be validated on another platform to verify that its significance is not an artifact of study design.},

Perturbations in one-carbon metabolism have been implicated in increased risk of some cancers and may also affect inflammatory processes. We investigated these interrelated pathways to understand their relation. The objective was to explore associations between inflammation and biomarkers of nutritional status and one-carbon metabolism. In a cross-sectional study in 1976 women selected from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, plasma vitamin B-6 [pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)], plasma vitamin B-12, plasma folate, and RBC folate were measured as nutritional biomarkers; serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) were measured as biomarkers of inflammation; and homocysteine and cysteine were measured as integrated biomarkers of one-carbon metabolism. Student's t, chi-square, and Spearman rank correlations, along with multiple linear regressions, were used to explore relations between biomarkers; additionally, we tested stratification by folic acid fortification period and multivitamin use. With the use of univariate analysis, plasma PLP was the only nutritional biomarker that was modestly significantly correlated with serum CRP and SAA ($\rho$ = -0.22 and -0.12, respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001). Homocysteine ($\mu$mol/L) showed significant inverse correlations with all nutritional biomarkers (ranging from $\rho$ = -0.30 to $\rho$ = -0.46; all P {\textless} 0.0001). With the use of multiple linear regression, plasma PLP, RBC folate, homocysteine, and cysteine were identified as independent predictors of CRP; and PLP, vitamin B-12, RBC folate, and homocysteine were identified as predictors of SAA. When stratified by folic acid fortification period, nutrition-homocysteine correlations were generally weaker in the postfortification period, whereas associations between plasma PLP and serum CRP increased. Biomarkers of inflammation are associated with PLP, RBC folate, and homocysteine in women. The connection between the pathways needs to be further investigated and causality established.

abstract = {Background: Red meat intake has been associated with risk of colorectal cancer, potentially mediated through heterocyclic amines. The metabolic efficiency of N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) required for the metabolic activation of such amines is influenced by genetic variation. The interaction between red meat intake, NAT2 genotype, and colorectal cancer has been inconsistently reported. Methods:Weused pooled individual-level data from the Colon Cancer Family Registry and the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium. Red meat intake was collected by each study. We inferred NAT2 phenotype based on polymorphism at rs1495741, highly predictive of enzyme activity. Interaction was assessed using multiplicative interaction terms in multivariate-adjusted models. Results: From 11 studies, 8,290 colorectal cancer cases and 9,115 controls were included. The highest quartile of red meat intake was associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer compared with the lowest quartile [OR, 1.41; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.29-1.55].However, a significant association was observed only for studies with retrospective diet data, not for studies with diet prospectively assessed before cancer diagnosis. Combining all studies, high red meat intake was similarly associated with colorectal cancer in those with a rapid/intermediate NAT2 genotype (OR, 1.38; 95{\%} CI, 1.20-1.59) as with a slow genotype (OR, 1.43; 95{\%} CI, 1.28-1.61; P interaction = 0.9). Conclusion:Wefound that high red meat intake was associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer only from retrospective case-control studies and not modified by NAT2 enzyme activity. Impact: Our results suggest no interaction between NAT2 genotype and red meat intake in mediating risk of colorectal cancer., Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Latinas and African-Americans with breast cancer, especially those of lower socioeconomic status and acculturation, have been underrepresented in studies assessing treatment satisfaction, decision-making, and quality of life. A study was designed to recruit a large and representative sample of these subgroups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Incident cases were selected by rapid case ascertainment (RCA) in the Los Angeles Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Registry from 2005 to 2006, with oversampling of Latinas and African-Americans. Patients were mailed a questionnaire and {\$}10 incentive 5 to 6 months after diagnosis; nonrespondents were contacted by telephone. Multivariate analysis was used to assess possible response bias. The RCA definition of Hispanic origin was validated by self-reports. The Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics index for Latina respondents was used. RESULTS: One thousand six hundred and ninety-eight eligible breast cancer cases were selected and 1,223 participated, for a response rate of 72.0{\%}, which varied little by race/ethnicity. Age, race/ethnicity, and clinical factors were not associated with response; however, respondents were slightly more likely to be married and from higher socioeconomic status census tracts than nonrespondents. The RCA definition of Hispanic identity was highly sensitive (94.6{\%}) and specific (90.0{\%}). Lower acculturation was associated with lower education and literacy among Latinas. DISCUSSION: High response rates among all subgroups were achieved due to the use of RCA, an incentive, extensive telephone follow-up, a native Spanish-speaking interviewer, and a focused questionnaire. The low acculturation index category identified a highly vulnerable subgroup. This large sample representing subgroups with greater problems will provide a basis for developing better interventions to assist these women.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with sexual activity in a national representative sample of Hispanic female adolescents. The subjects included all (n = 202) 15- to 19-year-old Hispanic female adolescents from the 1982 National Survey of Family Growth subdivided into Mexican-American (n = 119), Puerto Rican (n = 34), Central/South American (n = 23), Cuban (n = 9), and other Hispanic (n = 17) background groups. A total of 42{\%} of the young women were sexually active. More Cubans (69.0{\%}) and Central/South Americans (55.6{\%}) reported sexual activity than the other groups, but the differences were not statistically significant. With multiple regression analysis, a significant amount of variation (total R2 = 0.367, P less than or equal to .001) in sexual activity was explained by the following variables: not being in school (22.5{\%}), no religious affiliation (4.4{\%}), age (3.3{\%}), less church attendance (3.0{\%}), older age at menarche (1.9{\%}), and not living with both parents at age 14 years (1.9{\%}). These findings suggest that maintaining social continuity in the areas of school, church affiliation and involvement, and family structure, as well as physical maturity are associated with Hispanic adolescent girls not becoming sexually active.},

abstract = {To investigate the association between intake of freshwater fish and
their fatty acids and the risk of breast cancer in Chinese women, we
conducted a case-control study with 669 cases and 682 population-based
controls in Jiangsu Province of China. A structured questionnaire was
used to elicit detailed information. Unconditional logistic regression
analysis was performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%}
confidence intervals (CIs). Total freshwater fish intake was linked to
decrease in the adjusted OR for breast cancer, but without
dose-dependence. Analyses by freshwater fish species showed that
consumption of black carp and silver carp was inversely related to
breast cancer risk, with adjusted-ORs for the highest intake category of
black carp ({\textgreater}= 500g/month) of 0.54 (95{\%} CI=0.33-0.92; P-trend{\textless}0.002)
and for silver carp ({\textgreater}= 1000g/month) of 0.19 (95{\%} CI=0.11-0.33;
P-trend{\textless}0.001). In contrast, consumption of crucian carp was positively
related to breast cancer risk, with an adjusted OR for the highest
intake category ({\textgreater}= 1000g/month) of 6.09 (95{\%} CI=3.04-12.2;
P-trend{\textless}0.001). Moderate intakes of SFA, PUFA, n3-PUFA and n6-PUFA from
freshwater fish may decrease the risk of breast cancer among
premenopausal women. The findings of this study suggest that intake of
freshwater fish and their fatty acids may modify risk of breast cancer,
and that different species of freshwater fish could have a different
actions on breast cancer risk. Future epidemiologic studies are needed
to know the effects of freshwater fish intake on breast cancer risk and
the cause of these effects.},

abstract = {While incidence and mortality rates for most cancers (including lung, colorectum, female breast, and prostate) are decreasing in the United States and many other western countries, they are increasing in several less developed and economically transitioning countries because of adoption of unhealthy western lifestyles such as smoking and physical inactivity and consumption of calorie-dense food. Indeed, the rates for lung and colon cancers in a few of these countries have already surpassed those in the United States and other western countries. Most developing countries also continue to be disproportionately affected by cancers related to infectious agents, such as cervix, liver, and stomach cancers. The proportion of new cancer cases diagnosed in less developed countries is projected to increase from about 56{\%} of the world total in 2008 to more than 60{\%} in 2030 because of the increasing trends in cancer rates and expected increases in life expectancy and growth of the population. In this review, we describe these changing global incidence and mortality patterns for select common cancers and the opportunities for cancer prevention in developing countries.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Ischemic stroke (IS) accounts for around 80-85{\%} of total stroke and is a complex polygenic multi-factorial disorder which is affected by a complex combination of vascular, environmental, and genetic factors. OBJECTIVE The study was conducted with an aim to examine the relationship of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PDE4D (T83C, C87T, and C45T) gene with increasing risk of IS in patients in North Indian population. METHODS In this hospital-based case-control study, 250 IS subjects and 250 age-and sex-matched control subjects were enrolled from the Neurosciences Centre, A.I.I.M.S., New Delhi, India. Deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs) were extracted using the conventional Phenol-Chloroform isolation method. Different genotypes were determined by Polymerase chain reaction- Restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Odds ratio (OR) and 95{\%} Confidence Interval (CI) of relationship of polymorphisms with risk of IS were calculated by conditional multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS High blood pressure, low socioeconomic status, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and family history of stroke were observed to be statistically significant risk factors for IS. Multivariable adjusted analysis demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between SNP 83 of PDE4D gene polymorphism and increasing odds of IS under the dominant model of inheritance (OR, 1.59; 95{\%} CI, 1.02 to 2.50; p value = 0.04) after adjustment of potential confounding variables. Stratified analysis on the basis of TOAST classification demonstrated a statistically significant association for increasing 2.73 times odds for developing large vessel disease stroke as compared to controls (OR, 2.73; 95{\%} CI, 1.16 to 0.02; p value = 0.02). We did not find any significant association of SNPs (C87T and C45T) of the PDE4D gene with the risk of IS. CONCLUSION SNP 83 of PDE4D gene may increase the risk for developing IS whereas SNP 87 and SNP45 of PDE4D may not be associated with the risk of IS in the North Indian population. Prospective cohort studies are required to corroborate these findings.},

Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate whether offering lifestyle interventions to BC survivors could affect the levels of certain biomarkers involved in these mechanisms. We designed a pre-post intervention study offering diet and exercise sessions over 12 weeks to 42 overweight/obese BC survivors. Before and after the intervention, we obtained dietary information, anthropometry and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) measurements and blood samples to measure metabolic risk, insulin resistance and adipokines biomarkers. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and Spearman partial correlation coefficients were used to compare pre- and post-measurements and assess the correlations between changes in biomarkers and changes in anthropometry and CRF. Breast cancer survivors showed significant improvements in metabolic risk biomarkers and insulin resistance indicators along with a non-significant leptin decrease and a significant adiponectin decrease. The improvements in metabolic risk biomarkers, insulin resistance indicators and leptin were moderately correlated (0.32 ≤ |r| ≤ 0.55) with the decrease in body mass index and the increase in CRF. Diet and exercise interventions implemented in overweight/obese BC survivors may improve metabolic risk, insulin resistance and leptin biomarkers.},

We aimed to determine how these variants combine with a subset of other known risk factors to influence breast cancer risk in white women of European ancestry using case-control studies participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. We evaluated two-way interactions between each of age at menarche, ever having had a live birth, number of live births, age at first birth and body mass index (BMI) and each of 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (10q26-rs2981582 (FGFR2), 8q24-rs13281615, 11p15-rs3817198 (LSP1), 5q11-rs889312 (MAP3K1), 16q12-rs3803662 (TOX3), 2q35-rs13387042, 5p12-rs10941679 (MRPS30), 17q23-rs6504950 (COX11), 3p24-rs4973768 (SLC4A7), CASP8-rs17468277, TGFB1-rs1982073 and ESR1-rs3020314). Interactions were tested for by fitting logistic regression models including per-allele and linear trend main effects for SNPs and risk factors, respectively, and single-parameter interaction terms for linear departure from independent multiplicative effects. These analyses were applied to data for up to 26,349 invasive breast cancer cases and up to 32,208 controls from 21 case-control studies. No statistical evidence of interaction was observed beyond that expected by chance. Analyses were repeated using data from 11 population-based studies, and results were very similar. The relative risks for breast cancer associated with the common susceptibility variants identified to date do not appear to vary across women with different reproductive histories or body mass index (BMI). The assumption of multiplicative combined effects for these established genetic and other risk factors in risk prediction models appears justified.},

abstract = {Dietary epidemiological studies indicate correlations between the consumption of red meat and/or processed meat and cancer of the colon, rectum, stomach, pancreas, bladder, endometrium and ovaries, prostate, breast and lung, heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. The correlation of all these major diseases with dietary red meat indicates the presence of factors in red meat that damage biological components. This hypothesis will focus on the biochemistry of heme compounds and their oxidative processes. Raw red meat contains high levels of oxymyoglobin and deoxymyoglobin and oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin and cytochromes in muscle and other tissues. Cooked and processed meat contain hemichromes and hemochromes. After being eaten heme proteins are hydrolyzed to amino acids and peptides and the heme group which is coordinated with strong ligands. The iron of heme coordinates to the sulfur, nitrogen or oxygen of amino acids and peptides and other biological components. The coordinated heme groups are absorbed and transported by the blood to every organ and tissue. Free and coordinated heme preferentially catalyze oxidative reactions. Heme catalyzed oxidations can damage lipids, proteins, DNA and other nucleic acids and various components of biological systems. Heme catalysis with hydroperoxide intermediates can initiate further oxidations some of which would result in oxidative chain reactions. Biochemical and tissue free radical damage caused by heme catalyzed oxidations is similar to that resulting from ionizing radiation. Oxidative biochemical damage is widespread in diseases. It is apparent that decreasing the amount of dietary red meat will limit the level of oxidative catalysts in the tissues of the body. Increasing consumption of vegetables and fruits elevates the levels of antioxidative components, for example, selenium, vitamin E, vitamin C, lycopene, cysteine-glutathione and various phytochemicals. These detrimental processes of heme catalysis of oxidative damage hypothesized here are not well recognized. More investigative studies in this field need to be done. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) may be implicated in human colon carcinogenesis, but the toxicological mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. Because it was previously demonstrated that nitrosamines and nitrosamides, representing two classes of NOC, induce distinct gene expression effects in colon cells that are particularly related to oxidative stress, we hypothesized that different radical mechanisms are involved. Using electron spin resonance spectroscopy, we investigated the radical-generating properties of genotoxic NOC concentrations in human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2). Cells were exposed to nitrosamides (N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea) or nitrosamines (N-nitrosodiethylamine, N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosopiperidine, and N-nitrosopyrrolidine). Nitrosamines caused formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and carbon-centered radicals, which was further stimulated in the presence of Caco-2 cells. N-methyl-N-nitrosourea exposure resulted in a small ROS signal, and formation of nitrogen-centered radicals (NCRs), also stimulated by Caco-2 cells. N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine did not cause radical formation at genotoxic concentrations, but at increased exposure levels, both ROS and NCR formation was observed. By associating gene expression patterns with ROS formation, several cellular processes responding to nitrosamine exposure were identified, including apoptosis, cell cycle blockage, DNA repair, and oxidative stress. These findings suggest that following NOC exposure in Caco-2 cells, ROS formation plays an important role in deregulation of gene expression patterns that may be relevant for the process of chemical carcinogenesis in the human colon, in addition to the role of DNA alkylation.},

Routine epidemiologic analyses of such associations have tended to rely on standard contingency table or logistic regression methods, typically focusing on one variable at a time or pairwise combinations. We consider two statistical alternatives to this approach, one based on Bayesian model averaging, one based on pharmacokinetic modeling of the biochemical pathways. These approaches are illustrated using data from a case-control study of colorectal polyps in relation to tobacco smoking and consumption of well done red meat, both viewed as sources of heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The new analyses are structured in a manner that attempts to take advantage of prior knowledge of the metabolism of these classes of compounds and the various genes that regulate these pathways.},

Tumor DNA samples of 2,480 breast cancer patients were available. Out of this cohort, 1,290 patients with lymph-node negative disease who did not receive adjuvant systemic therapy, the SNP status was associated with metastasis-free survival (MFS). In 1,401 patients, the mRNA expression levels of FGFR2, LSP1, MAP3K1, H19, TOX3, POU5F1P1, and MYC were determined and correlated with SNP genotypes. The SNP rs2981582 in FGFR2 was significantly associated with positive ER and PgR status (P {\textless} 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively). No other significant associations with patient or tumor characteristics were observed. Only rs2107425 near H19 was significantly associated with shorter MFS in uni- and multi-variate analysis (HR: 1.53, CI: 1.12-2.08, P = 0.006 and HR: 1.59, CI: 1.16-2.20, P = 0.004, respectively), with the more aggressive minor allele displaying a recessive trait. The minor allele of SNP rs3803662 located near the TOX3 gene was associated with lower mRNA expression of this gene. In conclusion, except for the association of rs13283662 with TOX3 gene expression indicating a tumor suppressor role of TOX3, our findings suggest that breast cancer low-risk loci generally do not affect expression of the nearest gene in breast tumor tissue. Also the prognosis of patients is largely not affected by low-risk breast cancer loci except for the SNP near H19. How, this SNP affects prognosis warrants further study as it does not operate through altering H19 mRNA expression.},

abstract = {The expression and quantitation of the estrogen receptor (ER) in human thyroid tumors were examined by biochemical, immunohistochemical, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques. For this study, neoplasms, adenomatous goiters and adjacent normal thyroid tissues were obtained from 35 patients which included 10 cases of papillary carcinomas, 17 cases of adenomas and 8 cases of adenomatous goiters. Regardless of the histopathological subtype, ER was detected in 19{\%} (5/27) of the neoplastic tissues with the mean value of ER content of 5.0 +/- 1.3 fmol/mg protein and the mean Kd value of 0.38 +/- 0.28 nM. ER was also detected, but at a lower concentration (2.8 +/- 1.6 fmol/mg protein), in the surrounding normal tissues. There was no significant difference between the neoplasms and adenomatous goiters with respect to the incidence of ER positivity and ER content. Furthermore, ER-positive specimens, as determined by both biochemical and immunohistochemical techniques, also showed the expression of ER mRNA detected by RT-PCR method. These results demonstrate that both ER mRNA as well as ER protein are expressed in thyroid neoplasms. This suggests the possibility that estrogen may affect the tumorigenesis or the progression of some thyroid neoplasms.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The overall objective of this study was to evaluate and provide evidence and recommendations on current published literature about diet and lifestyle in the prevention of type 2 diabetes. DESIGN Epidemiological and experimental studies, focusing on nutritional intervention in the prevention of type 2 diabetes are used to make disease-specific recommendations. Long-term cohort studies are given the most weight as to strength of evidence available. SETTING AND SUBJECTS Numerous clinical trials and cohort studies in low, middle and high income countries are evaluated regarding recommendations for dietary prevention of type 2 diabetes. These include, among others, the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study, US Diabetes Prevention Program, Da Qing Study; Pima Indian Study; Iowa Women's Health Study; and the study of the US Male Physicians. RESULTS There is convincing evidence for a decreased risk of diabetes in adults who are physically active and maintain a normal body mass index (BMI) throughout adulthood, and in overweight adults with impaired glucose tolerance who lose weight voluntarily. An increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes is associated with overweight and obesity; abdominal obesity; physical inactivity; and maternal diabetes. It is probable that a high intake of saturated fats and intrauterine growth retardation also contribute to an increased risk, while non-starch polysaccharides are likely to be associated with a decreased risk. From existing evidence it is also possible that omega-3 fatty acids, low glycaemic index foods and exclusive breastfeeding may play a protective role, and that total fat intake and trans fatty acids may contribute to the risk. However, insufficient evidence is currently available to provide convincing proof. CONCLUSIONS Based on the strength of available evidence regarding diet and lifestyle in the prevention of type 2 diabetes, it is recommended that a normal weight status in the lower BMI range (BMI 21-23) and regular physical activity be maintained throughout adulthood; abdominal obesity be prevented; and saturated fat intake be less than 7{\{}{\%}{\}} of the total energy intake.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Current evidence suggests that high red meat intake is associated with increased colorectal cancer risk. High fish intake may be associated with a decreased risk, but the existing evidence is less convincing. METHODS We prospectively followed 478 040 men and women from 10 European countries who were free of cancer at enrollment between 1992 and 1998. Information on diet and lifestyle was collected at baseline. After a mean follow-up of 4.8 years, 1329 incident colorectal cancers were documented. We examined the relationship between intakes of red and processed meat, poultry, and fish and colorectal cancer risk using a proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, energy (nonfat and fat sources), height, weight, work-related physical activity, smoking status, dietary fiber and folate, and alcohol consumption, stratified by center. A calibration substudy based on 36 994 subjects was used to correct hazard ratios (HRs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for diet measurement errors. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS Colorectal cancer risk was positively associated with intake of red and processed meat (highest [{\textgreater}160 g/day] versus lowest [{\textless}20 g/day] intake, HR = 1.35, 95{\%} CI = 0.96 to 1.88; Ptrend = .03) and inversely associated with intake of fish ({\textgreater}80 g/day versus {\textless}10 g/day, HR = 0.69, 95 {\%} CI = 0.54 to 0.88; Ptrend{\textless}.001), but was not related to poultry intake. Correcting for measurement error strengthened the associations between colorectal cancer and red and processed meat intake (per 100-g increase HR = 1.25, 95{\%} CI =1.09 to 1.41, Ptrend = .001 and HR = 1.55, 95{\%} CI = 1.19 to 2.02, Ptrend = .001 before and after calibration, respectively) and for fish (per 100 g increase HR = 0.70, 95{\%} CI = 0.57 to 0.87, Ptrend{\textless}.001 and HR = 0.46, 95{\%} CI = 0.27 to 0.77, Ptrend = .003; before and after correction, respectively). In this study population, the absolute risk of development of colorectal cancer within 10 years for a study subject aged 50 years was 1.71{\%} for the highest category of red and processed meat intake and 1.28{\%} for the lowest category of intake and was 1.86{\%} for subjects in the lowest category of fish intake and 1.28{\%} for subjects in the highest category of fish intake. CONCLUSIONS Our data confirm that colorectal cancer risk is positively associated with high consumption of red and processed meat and support an inverse association with fish intake.},

abstract = {With a typical sample size of a few thousand subjects, a single genome-wide association study (GWAS) using traditional one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-at-a-time methods can only detect genetic variants conferring a sizable effect on disease risk. Set-based methods, which analyze sets of SNPs jointly, can detect variants with smaller effects acting within a gene, a pathway, or other biologically relevant sets. Although self-contained set-based methods (those that test sets of variants without regard to variants not in the set) are generally more powerful than competitive set-based approaches (those that rely on comparison of variants in the set of interest with variants not in the set), there is no consensus as to which self-contained methods are best. In particular, several self-contained set tests have been proposed to directly or indirectly "adapt" to the a priori unknown proportion and distribution of effects of the truly associated SNPs in the set, which is a major determinant of their power. A popular adaptive set-based test is the adaptive rank truncated product (ARTP), which seeks the set of SNPs that yields the best-combined evidence of association. We compared the standard ARTP, several ARTP variations we introduced, and other adaptive methods in a comprehensive simulation study to evaluate their performance. We used permutations to assess significance for all the methods and thus provide a level playing field for comparison. We found the standard ARTP test to have the highest power across our simulations followed closely by the global model of random effects (GMRE) and a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-based test.},

Approximately 51,000 DNA samples from distinct individuals have been genotyped using genome-wide SNP arrays across the nine sites of the network. The eMERGE Coordinating Center and the Genomics Workgroup developed a pipeline to impute and merge genomic data across the different SNP arrays to maximize sample size and power to detect associations with a variety of clinical endpoints. The 1000 Genomes cosmopolitan reference panel was used for imputation. Imputation results were evaluated using the following metrics: accuracy of imputation, allelic R (2) (estimated correlation between the imputed and true genotypes), and the relationship between allelic R (2) and minor allele frequency. Computation time and memory resources required by two different software packages (BEAGLE and IMPUTE2) were also evaluated. A number of challenges were encountered due to the complexity of using two different imputation software packages, multiple ancestral populations, and many different genotyping platforms. We present lessons learned and describe the pipeline implemented here to impute and merge genomic data sets. The eMERGE imputed dataset will serve as a valuable resource for discovery, leveraging the clinical data that can be mined from the EHR.},

abstract = {Among US Latinas and Mexican women, those with higher European ancestry have increased risk of breast cancer. We combined an admixture mapping and genome-wide association mapping approach to search for genomic regions that may explain this observation. Latina women with breast cancer (n= 1497) and Latina controls (n= 1272) were genotyped using Affymetrix and Illumina arrays. We inferred locus-specific genetic ancestry and compared the ancestry between cases and controls. We also performed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association analyses in regions of interest. Correction for multiple-hypothesis testing was conducted using permutations (P(corrected)). We identified one region where genetic ancestry was significantly associated with breast cancer risk: 6q25 [odds ratio (OR) per Indigenous American chromosome 0.75, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.65-0.85, P= 1.1 × 10(-5), P(corrected)= 0.02]. A second region on 11p15 showed a trend towards association (OR per Indigenous American chromosome 0.77, 95{\%} CI: 0.68-0.87, P= 4.3 × 10(-5), P(corrected)= 0.08). In both regions, breast cancer risk decreased with higher Indigenous American ancestry in concordance with observations made on global ancestry. The peak of the 6q25 signal includes the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene and 5' region, a locus previously implicated in breast cancer. Genome-wide association analysis found that a multi-SNP model explained the admixture signal in both regions. Our results confirm that the association between genetic ancestry and breast cancer risk in US Latinas is partly due to genetic differences between populations of European and Indigenous Americans origin. Fine-mapping within the 6q25 and possibly the 11p15 loci will lead to the discovery of the biologically functional variant/s behind this association.},

abstract = {Breast cancer risk has been hypothesized to increase with exposure to heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) formed from cooking meat at high temperature. HAAs require enzymatic activation to bind to DNA and initiate carcinogenesis. N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) enzyme activity may play a role, its rate determined by a polymorphic gene. We examined the effect of NAT2 genetic polymorphisms on breast cancer risk from exposure to meat by cooking method, doneness and estimated HAA [2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazole[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx)] intake. Women were recruited with suspicious breast masses and questionnaire data were collected prior to biopsy to blind subjects and interviewers to diagnoses. For 114 cases with breast cancer and 280 controls with benign breast disease, NAT2 genotype was determined using allele-specific PCR amplification to detect slow acetylator mutations. HAAs were estimated from interview data on meat type, cooking method and doneness, combined with a quantitative HAA database. Logistic regression models controlled for known risk factors, first including all controls, then 108 with no or low risk (normal breast or no hyperplasia) and finally 149 with high risk (hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasia, complex fibroadenomas). Meat effects were examined within NAT2 strata to assess interactions. We found no association between NAT2 and breast cancer. These Californian women ate more white than red meat (control median 46 versus 8 g/day). There were no significant associations of breast cancer with red meat for any doneness. White meat was significantly protective ({\textgreater}67 versus {\textless}26 g/day, OR 0.46, 95{\%} CI 0.23-0.94, P for trend = 0.02), as was chicken, including well done, pan fried and barbecued chicken. MeIQx and DiMeIQx were not associated with breast cancer. A protective effect of PhIP was confounded after controlling for well done chicken. Results were unchanged using low or high risk controls or dropping 30 in situ cases. There was no interaction between NAT2 and HAAs. These findings do not support a role for HAAs from meat or NAT2 in the etiology of breast cancer. Further research is needed to explain the white meat association.},

Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations between meat variables and colorectal cancer; polytomous logistic regression was used for subsite-specific analyses.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq has become increasingly popular in transcriptome profiling. One aspect of transcriptome research is to quantify the expression levels of genomic elements, such as genes, their transcripts and exons. Acquiring a transcriptome expression profile requires genomic elements to be defined in the context of the genome. Multiple human genome annotation databases exist, including RefGene (RefSeq Gene), Ensembl, and the UCSC annotation database. The impact of the choice of an annotation on estimating gene expression remains insufficiently investigated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this paper, we systematically characterized the impact of genome annotation choice on read mapping and transcriptome quantification by analyzing a RNA-Seq dataset generated by the Human Body Map 2.0 Project. The impact of a gene model on mapping of non-junction reads is different from junction reads. For the RNA-Seq dataset with a read length of 75 bp, on average, 95{\%} of non-junction reads were mapped to exactly the same genomic location regardless of which gene models was used. By contrast, this percentage dropped to 53{\%} for junction reads. In addition, about 30{\%} of junction reads failed to align without the assistance of a gene model, while 10-15{\%} mapped alternatively. There are 21,958 common genes among RefGene, Ensembl, and UCSC annotations. When we compared the gene quantification results in RefGene and Ensembl annotations, 20{\%} of genes are not expressed, and thus have a zero count in both annotations. Surprisingly, identical gene quantification results were obtained for only 16.3{\%} (about one sixth) of genes. Approximately 28.1{\%} of genes' expression levels differed by 5{\%} or higher, and of those, the relative expression levels for 9.3{\%} of genes (equivalent to 2038) differed by 50{\%} or greater. The case studies revealed that the gene definition differences in gene models frequently result in inconsistency in gene quantification.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the choice of a gene model has a dramatic effect on both gene quantification and differential analysis. Our research will help RNA-Seq data analysts to make an informed choice of gene model in practical RNA-Seq data analysis.},

A small proportion (3-5{\%}) of cases arise from hereditary syndromes predisposing to early onset CRC as a result of mutations in over a dozen well defined genes. In contrast, CRC is predominantly a late onset 'sporadic' disease, developing in individuals with no obvious hereditary syndrome. In recent years, genome wide association studies have discovered that over 40 genetic regions are associated with weak effects on sporadic CRC, and it has been estimated that increasingly large genome wide scans will identify many additional novel genetic regions. Subsequent experimental validations have identified the causally related variant(s) in a limited number of these genetic regions. Further biological insight could be obtained through ethnically diverse study populations, larger genetic sequencing studies and development of higher throughput functional experiments. Along with inherited variation, integration of the tumour genome may shed light on the carcinogenic processes in CRC. In addition to summarising the genetic architecture of CRC, this review discusses genetic factors that modify environmental predictors of CRC, as well as examples of how genetic insight has improved clinical surveillance, prevention and treatment strategies. In summary, substantial progress has been made in uncovering the genetic architecture of CRC, and continued research efforts are expected to identify additional genetic risk factors that further our biological understanding of this disease. Subsequently these new insights will lead to improved treatment and prevention of colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HCAs), which arise from cooking meat and fish at high temperatures, may increase the risk of colorectal adenomas. Conversely, flavonoids might counteract the negative effects of HCAs. OBJECTIVE: The association between dietary HCA intake and colorectal adenoma incidence was investigated in a prospective cohort study. DESIGN: At recruitment (1994-1998), detailed information on diet, anthropometric measures, lifestyle, and medication use was assessed in 25,540 participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Heidelberg cohort study. Dietary HCA intake was estimated by using information from food-frequency questionnaires on meat consumption, applied cooking methods, and preferred degree of browning. Until June 2007, 516 verified incident colorectal adenomas were identified. Participants with negative colonoscopy (n = 3966) were also included in the analytic cohort. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the association between colorectal adenoma risk and intake of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), and 2-amino-3,4,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx). RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, the intake of PhIP as the most abundant dietary HCA was associated with an increased risk of colorectal adenoma (relative risk: 1.47; 95{\%} CI: 1.13, 1.93; quartile 4 compared with quartile 1; P for trend = 0.002), but no statistically significant associations were observed for MeIQx and DiMeIQx intakes. In addition, adenoma risk also increased with the consumption of strongly or extremely browned meat (P for trend = 0.04). The association of PhIP intake with adenoma risk was most pronounced for small adenomas (P for trend = 0.01) and adenomas localized in the distal colon (P for trend = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The results of this first European cohort study support data from case-control studies of a positive association between HCA intake and colorectal adenoma risk.},

The transcriptional repression of ER-alpha gene in breast cancer is an area of active investigation with potential clinical significance. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the ER-alpha gene expression are not fully understood. Here we show a new molecular mechanism of ER-alpha gene inactivation mediated by pRb2/p130 in ER-negative breast cancer cells. We investigated in vivo occupancy of ER-alpha promoter by pRb2/p130-E2F4/5-HDAC1-SUV39 H1-p300 and pRb2/p130-E2F4/5-HDAC1-SUV39H1-DNMT1 complexes, and provided a link between pRb2/p130 and chromatin-modifying enzymes in the regulation of ER-alpha transcription in a physiological setting. These findings suggest that pRb2/p130-multimolecular complexes can be key elements in the regulation of ER-alpha gene expression and may be viewed as promising targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in the treatment of breast cancer, especially for those tumors that are ER negative.},

We evaluated genetic variation in MMP1 (9 SNPs), MMP2 (8 SNPs), MMP3 (4 SNPs), and MMP9 (3 SNPs) and breast cancer risk among Hispanic (2111 cases, 2597 controls) and non-Hispanic white (NHW) (1481 cases, 1586 controls) women in the Breast Cancer Health Disparities Study. Ancestral informative markers (n = 104) were assessed to determine Native American (NA) ancestry. MMP1 [4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] and MMP2 (2 SNPs) were associated with breast cancer overall. MMP1 rs996999 had strongest associations among women with the most NA ancestry (OR 1.61,95{\%} CI 1.09,2.40) as did MMP3 rs650108 (OR 1.36, 95{\%} CI 1.05,1.75) and MMP9 rs3787268 (OR 1.52, 95{\%} CI 1.09,2.13). The adaptive rank truncated product (ARTP) showed a significant pathway p(artp)  value of 0.04, with a stronger association among women with the most NA ancestry (p(artp) = 0.02). Significant pathway genes using the ARTP were MMP1 for all women (p(artp) = 0.02) and MMP9 for women with the most NA ancestry (p(artp) = 0.024); MMP2 was borderline significant overall (p(artp) =0.06) and MMP1 and MMP3 were borderline significant for women with the most NA ancestry (p(artp) = 0.07 and 0.06 respectively). MMP1 and MMP2 were associated with ER+/PR+ and ER+/PR-tumors; MMP3 and MMP9 were associated with ER-/PR- tumors. The pathway was highly significant with survival (p(artp) = 0.0041) with MMP2 having the strongest gene association (p(artp) = 0.0007). Our findings suggest that genetic variation in MMP genes influence breast cancer development and survival in this genetically admixed population.},

Using data from the California Cancer Registry, we investigated demographic and clinical characteristics of 36,133 Latinos with CRC living in California during 1995-2011 taking into account subpopulations defined by country of origin.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Cases were defined as Latino according to the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries Hispanic Identification Algorithm, which was also used to group cases by country of origin: Mexico (9,678, 27 {\%}), Central or South America (2,636, 7 {\%}), Cuban (558, 2 {\%}), Puerto Rico (295, 1 {\%}), and other or unknown origin (22,966, 64 {\%}; Other/NOS). 174,710 non-Hispanic white (NHW) CRC cases were included for comparison purposes. Annual age-adjusted incidence rates (AAIR) and proportional incidence ratios (PIRs) were calculated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Differences were observed for age at diagnosis, sex distribution, socioeconomic status (SES), nativity (US born vs. foreign born), stage, and tumor localization across Latino subpopulations and compared to NHW. Mexican Latinos had the lowest AAIR and Cuban Latinos had the highest. PIRs adjusted for age, SES, and nativity showed an excess of CRC males and female cases from Cuba, female cases from Puerto Rico and reduced number of female cases from Mexico.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Differences in cancer incidence patterns and tumor characteristics were observed among Latino subpopulations in California. These disparities may reflect differences in cancer determinants among Latinos; therefore, given that country of origin information is unavailable for a large proportion of these patients, greater efforts to collect these data are warranted.},

This review focuses on the relationship of red meat with cancer, its dependency on the thermal processing methodology and the subsequent physiological effects. The epidemiological evidence is discussed, followed by introduction of the species that were hypothesized to contribute to these carcinogenic effects including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heterocyclic amines (HCAs), N-nitroso compounds (NOCs), heme iron, and macromolecular oxidation products. Their carcinogenic mechanisms were then addressed with further emphasis on the involvement of inflammation and oxidative stress. The thermal processing dependency of the carcinogen generation and the partially elucidated carcinogenic mechanism both represent doorways of opportunities available for the scientific manipulation of their impact after human consumption, to minimize the cancer risks associated with red meat.},

In recent years, it has become clear that some of these proteins as well as their receptors are produced in the organisms under physiological and pathological conditions. The exact initiation process of breast cancer is unknown, although several hypotheses have emerged. Inflammation has been proposed as an important player in tumor initiation, promotion, angiogenesis, and metastasis, all phenomena in which cytokines are prominent players. The data here suggest that cytokines play an important role in the regulation of both induction and protection in breast cancer.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Genetic association studies are conducted to discover genetic loci that contribute to an inherited trait, identify the variants behind these associations and ascertain their functional role in determining the phenotype. To date, functional annotations of the genetic variants have rarely played more than an indirect role in assessing evidence for association. Here, we demonstrate how these data can be systematically integrated into an association study's analysis plan.RESULTS:We developed a Bayesian statistical model for the prior probability of phenotype--genotype association that incorporates data from past association studies and publicly available functional annotation data regarding the susceptibility variants under study. The model takes the form of a binary regression of association status on a set of annotation variables whose coefficients were estimated through an analysis of associated SNPs in the GWAS Catalog (GC). The functional predictors examined included measures that have been demonstrated to correlate with the association status of SNPs in the GC and some whose utility in this regard is speculative: summaries of the UCSC Human Genome Browser ENCODE super--track data, dbSNP function class, sequence conservation summaries, proximity to genomic variants in the Database of Genomic Variants and known regulatory elements in the Open Regulatory Annotation database, PolyPhen--2 probabilities and RegulomeDB categories. Because we expected that only a fraction of the annotations would contribute to predicting association, we employed a penalized likelihood method to reduce the impact of non--informative predictors and evaluated the model's ability to predict GC SNPs not used to construct the model. We show that the functional data alone are predictive of a SNP's presence in the GC. Further, using data from a genome--wide study of ovarian cancer, we demonstrate that their use as prior data when testing for association is practical at the genome--wide scale and improves power to detect associations.CONCLUSIONS:We show how diverse functional annotations can be efficiently combined to create 'functional signatures' that predict the a priori odds of a variant's association to a trait and how these signatures can be integrated into a standard genome-wide-scale association analysis, resulting in improved power to detect truly associated variants.},

In 21 volunteers, there was a consistent and significant (P {\textless} 0.0001) increase in endogenous formation of NOC with the red meat diet compared with the vegetarian diet as measured by apparent total NOC (ATNC) in feces. In colonic exfoliated cells, the percentage staining positive for the NOC-specific DNA adduct, O(6)-carboxymethyl guanine (O(6)CMG) was significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) higher on the high red meat diet. In 13 volunteers, levels were intermediate on the high-fiber, high red meat diet. Fecal ATNC were positively correlated with the percentage of cells staining positive for O(6)CMG (r(2) = 0.56, P = 0.011). The presence of O(6)CMG was also shown in intact small intestine from rats treated with the N-nitrosopeptide N-acetyl-N'-prolyl-N'-nitrosoglycine and in HT-29 cells treated with diazoacetate. This study has shown that fecal NOC arising from red meat include direct acting diazopeptides or N-nitrosopeptides able to form alkylating DNA adducts in the colon. As these O(6)CMG adducts are not repaired, and if other related adducts are formed and not repaired, this may explain the association of red meat with colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {Objective: We measured the difference of dietary intake and eating habits across socioeconomic statuses (SESs) in Israel. Methods: Participants were randomly recruited from three high SES municipalities and three low SES municipalities in the Negev. Participants were interviewed at home with 24-h food questionnaires that included additional questions regarding health and eating habits. Nutrient and energy intakes were compared between groups, as were major contributors to the energy and food groups. Results: One hundred sixteen participants from the high SES group and 206 from the low SES entered the study. Those in the low SES group were older, heavier, less educated, and less physically active. Dietary intake among the participants in the low SES group was significantly lower in protein, monounsaturated fat, and most vitamins and minerals (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, and iron). Conversely, vitamin E intake was higher in the low SES group. In the low SES group, the main contributors to energy intake were breads, oils, and sugars. Oils, fats, and citrus fruits were consumed more among subjects in the low SES group, whereas dairy products, grains, and legumes were consumed less by subjects in the high SES group. Conclusion: In a detailed survey conducted in two distinct populations, we found poorer diet quality in the low SES group. The root causes for such divergence need further study. As smoking declines in the modern world, nutrition will become the key risk factor in many diseases. Further research and educational and legislative initiatives are needed to curtail this risk. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

TCF7L2 variants rs12255372 and rs7903146 have been associated with risk of Type 2 diabetes. Few epidemiological studies have examined the association between TCF7L2 and breast cancer risk. We investigated the associations between 25 TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and breast cancer in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white (NHW) women from the 4-Corner's Breast Cancer Study, the San Francisco Bay Area Breast Cancer Study, and the Mexico Breast Cancer Study. A total of 4,703 Hispanic (2,093 cases, 2,610 controls) and 3,031 NHW (1,431 cases, 1,600 controls) women were included. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 {\%} confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic regression to estimate the association between the TCF7L2 SNPs and breast cancer risk. We also examined effect modification by self-reported ethnicity, genetic admixture, and diabetes history. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, four TCF7L2 SNPs were significantly associated with breast cancer overall: rs7903146 (OR(TT) 1.24; 95 {\%} CI 1.03-1.49), rs3750805 (OR(AT/TT) 1.15; 95 {\%} CI 1.03-1.28), rs7900150 (OR(AA) 1.23; 95 {\%} 1.07-1.42), and rs1225404 (OR(CC) 0.82; 95 {\%} 0.70-0.94). Among women with a history of diabetes, the TT genotype of rs3750804 increased breast cancer risk (OR, 2.46; 95 {\%} CI 1.28-4.73). However, there was no association among women without a diabetes history (OR, 1.06; 95 {\%} CI 0.85-1.32). We did not find significant interactions by ethnicity or by genetic admixture. Findings support an association between TCF7L2 and breast cancer and history of diabetes modifies this association for specific variants.},

abstract = {Background: Specific nutrients or foods have been inconsistently associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) risks. Thus, we investigated associations between diet as a whole, as dietary patterns, and UC and CD risks. Methods: Within the prospective EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer) study, we set up a nested matched case–control study among 366,351 participants with inflammatory bowel disease data, including 256 incident cases of UC and 117 of CD, and 4 matched controls per case. Dietary intake was recorded at baseline from validated food frequency questionnaires. Incidence rate ratios of developing UC and CD were calculated for quintiles of the Mediterranean diet score and a posteriori dietary patterns produced by factor analysis. Results: No dietary pattern was associated with either UC or CD risks. However, when excluding cases occurring within the first 2 years after dietary assessment, there was a positive association between a “high sugar and soft drinks” pattern and UC risk (incidence rate ratios for the fifth versus first quintile, 1.68 [1.00–2.82]; Ptrend ¼ 0.02). When considering the foods most associated with the pattern, high consumers of sugar and soft drinks were at higher UC risk only if they had low vegetables intakes. Conclusions: A diet imbalance with high consumption of sugar and soft drinks and low consumption of vegetables was associated with UC risk. Further studies are needed to investigate whether microbiota alterations or other mechanisms mediate this association},

abstract = {Background: High body mass index (BMI) is consistently linked to increased risk of colorectal cancer for men, whereas the association is less clear for women. As risk estimates from observational studies may be biased and/or confounded, we conducted a Mendelian randomization study to estimate the causal association between BMI and colorectal cancer. Methods:Weused data from 10,226 colorectal cancer cases and 10,286 controls of European ancestry. The Mendelian randomization analysis used a weighted genetic risk score, derived from 77 genome-wide association study-identified variants associated with higher BMI, as an instrumental variable (IV). We compared the IV odds ratio (IV-OR) with the OR obtained using a conventional covariate-adjusted analysis. Results: Individuals carrying greater numbers of BMI-increasing alleles had higher colorectal cancer risk [per weighted allele OR, 1.31; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.10-1.57]. Our IV estimation results support the hypothesis that genetically influenced BMI is directly associated with risk for colorectal cancer (IV-OR per 5 kg/m2, 1.50; 95{\%} CI, 1.13-2.01). In the sex-specific IV analyses higher BMI was associated with higher risk of colorectal cancer among women (IV-OR per 5 kg/m2, 1.82; 95{\%} CI, 1.26-2.61). For men, genetically influenced BMI was not associated with colorectal cancer (IV-OR per 5 kg/m2, 1.18; 95{\%} CI, 0.73-1.92). Conclusions: High BMI was associated with increased colorectal cancer risk for women. Whether abdominal obesity, rather than overall obesity, is a more important risk factor for men requires further investigation. Impact: Overall, conventional epidemiologic and Mendelian randomization studies suggest a strong association between obesity and the risk of colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {Heterocyclic amines (HAs) are carcinogens produced by high-temperature cooking of meat and animal protein; metabolism of HA is influenced by polymorphisms in the N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT-2) gene. Data from a variety of sources suggest that HA may play a role in human carcinogenesis. We examined the associations between meat intake and cooking method, acetylator genotype and breast cancer risk in a sub-cohort of 32,826 women in the Nurses' Health Study who gave a blood sample in 1989-1990. Women who were diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 466) after blood draw and prior to June 1, 1994, were matched to 466 controls. Overall, rapid acetylators were not at increased risk of breast cancer compared with slow acetylators (multivariate OR = 1.1, 95{\%} CI 0.8-1.5), and there were no associations between meat intake or cooking method of meat and breast cancer risk. Rapid acetylators with the highest red meat intake (one or more servings per day) were not at increased risk of breast cancer compared with slow acetylators with the lowest red meat intake (OR = 1.1, 95{\%} CI 0.7-1.8). Frequent intake of charred meat among rapid acetylators (one or more times per week) was not associated with increased risk (OR = 1.2, 95{\%} CI 0.6-2.3) compared with slow acetylators who ate charred meat less than once per month. We observed no significant associations for rapid acetylators who frequently consumed beef, pork or lamb cooked with high-temperature cooking methods, such as barbecuing (OR = 0.9, 95{\%} CI 0.4-1.9) or roasting (OR = 0.9, 95{\%} CI 0.5-1.6). Our data suggest that HAs may not be a major cause of breast cancer, although we cannot exclude misclassification of HA intake as the reason for the lack of association. We observed no evidence of differential susceptibility to these exposures by NAT2 genotype.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between intake of fish and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) and the risk of breast cancer and to evaluate the potential dose-response relation. DESIGN: Meta-analysis and systematic review of prospective cohort studies. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase up to December 2012 and references of retrieved relevant articles. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Prospective cohort studies with relative risk and 95{\%} confidence intervals for breast cancer according to fish intake, n-3 PUFA intake, or tissue biomarkers. RESULTS: Twenty six publications, including 20,905 cases of breast cancer and 883,585 participants from 21 independent prospective cohort studies were eligible. Eleven articles (13,323 breast cancer events and 687,770 participants) investigated fish intake, 17 articles investigated marine n-3 PUFA (16,178 breast cancer events and 527,392 participants), and 12 articles investigated alpha linolenic acid (14,284 breast cancer events and 405,592 participants). Marine n-3 PUFA was associated with 14{\%} reduction of risk of breast cancer (relative risk for highest v lowest category 0.86 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.78 to 0.94), I(2)=54), and the relative risk remained similar whether marine n-3 PUFA was measured as dietary intake (0.85, 0.76 to 0.96, I(2)=67{\%}) or as tissue biomarkers (0.86, 0.71 to 1.03, I(2)=8{\%}). Subgroup analyses also indicated that the inverse association between marine n-3 PUFA and risk was more evident in studies that did not adjust for body mass index (BMI) (0.74, 0.64 to 0.86, I(2)=0) than in studies that did adjust for BMI (0.90, 0.80 to 1.01, I(2)=63.2{\%}). Dose-response analysis indicated that risk of breast cancer was reduced by 5{\%} per 0.1g/day (0.95, 0.90 to 1.00, I(2)=52{\%}) or 0.1{\%} energy/day (0.95, 0.90 to 1.00, I(2)=79{\%}) increment of dietary marine n-3 PUFA intake. No significant association was observed for fish intake or exposure to alpha linolenic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Higher consumption of dietary marine n-3 PUFA is associated with a lower risk of breast cancer. The associations of fish and alpha linolenic acid intake with risk warrant further investigation of prospective cohort studies. These findings could have public health implications with regard to prevention of breast cancer through dietary and lifestyle interventions.},

Cox regression, adjusted for age, year of diagnosis, grade, and ER/PR/HER2 subtype, was used to assess the association of race/ethnicity on breast cancer-specific mortality within strata of stage and SES. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals were reported.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Stage 1: There was no increased risk of mortality for any race/ethnicity when compared with whites within all SES strata. Stage 2: Hispanics (HR = 0.85; 0.75, 0.97) in the lowest SES category had a reduced risk of mortality.. Blacks had the same risk of mortality as whites in the lowest SES category but an increased risk of mortality in the intermediate (HR = 1.66; 1.34, 2.06) and highest (HR = 1.41; 1.15, 1.73) SES categories. Stage 3: Hispanics (HR = 0.74; 0.64, 0.85) and APIs (HR = 0.64; 0.50, 0.82) in the lowest SES category had a reduced risk while blacks had similar mortality as whites.

abstract = {Gene-environment interaction (GEI) analysis can potentially enhance gene discovery for common complex traits. However, genome-wide interaction analysis is computationally intensive. Moreover, analysis of longitudinal data in families is much more challenging due to the two sources of correlations arising from longitudinal measurements and family relationships. GWIS of longitudinal family data can be a computational bottleneck. Therefore, we compared two methods for analysis of longitudinal family data: a methodologically sound but computationally demanding method using the Kronecker model (KRC) and a computationally more forgiving method using the hierarchical linear model (HLM). The KRC model uses a Kronecker product of an unstructured matrix for correlations among repeated measures (longitudinal) and a compound symmetry matrix for correlations within families at a given visit. The HLM uses an autoregressive covariance matrix for correlations among repeated measures and a random intercept for familial correlations. We compared the two methods using the longitudinal Framingham heart study (FHS) SHARe data. Specifically, we evaluated SNP-alcohol (amount of alcohol consumption) interaction effects on high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC). Keeping the prohibitive computational burden of KRC in mind, we limited the analysis to chromosome 16, where preliminary cross-sectional analysis yielded some interesting results. Our first important finding was that the HLM provided very comparable results but was remarkably faster than the KRC, making HLM the method of choice. Our second finding was that longitudinal analysis provided smaller P-values, thus leading to more significant results, than cross-sectional analysis. This was particularly pronounced in identifying GEIs. We conclude that longitudinal analysis of GEIs is more powerful and that the HLM method is an optimal method of choice as compared to the computationally (prohibitively) intensive KRC method.},

Objective: In the Continuous Update Project, we conducted a meta- analysis of prospective studies on intakes of dairy products and calcium and prostate cancer risk. Design: PubMed and several other databases were searched up to April 2013. Summary RRs were estimated by using a random-effects model. Results: Thirty-two studies were included. Intakes of total dairy products [summary RR: 1.07 (95{\%} CI: 1.02, 1.12; n = 15) per 400 g/d], total milk [summary RR: 1.03 (95{\%} CI: 1.00, 1.07; n = 14) per 200 g/d], low-fat milk [summary RR: 1.06 (95{\%} CI: 1.01, 1.11; n =6) per 200 g/d], cheese [summary RR: 1.09 (95{\%} CI: 1.02, 1.18; n =11) per 50 g/d], and dietary calcium [summary RR: 1.05 (95{\%} CI: 1.02, 1.09; n = 15) per 400 mg/d] were associated with increased total prostate cancer risk. Total calcium and dairy calcium intakes, but not nondairy calcium or supplemental calcium intakes, were also positively associated with total prostate cancer risk. Supplemental calcium was associated with increased risk of fatal prostate cancer. Conclusions: High intakes of dairy products, milk, low-fat milk, cheese, and total, dietary, and dairy calcium, but not supplemental or nondairy calcium, may increase total prostate cancer risk. The diverging results for types of dairy products and sources of calcium suggest that other components of dairy rather than fat and calcium may increase prostate cancer risk.

abstract = {Background Few data exist regarding the impact on survival of definitive treatment of the prostate in men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa). Objective To evaluate the survival of men diagnosed with mPCa based on definitive treatment of the prostate. Design, setting, and participants Men with documented stage IV (M1a-c) PCa at diagnosis identified using Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) (2004-2010) and divided based on definitive treatment of the prostate (radical prostatectomy [RP] or brachytherapy [BT]) or no surgery or radiation therapy (NSR). Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Kaplan-Meier methods were used to calculate overall survival (OS). Multivariable competing risks regression analysis was used to calculate disease-specific survival (DSS) probability and identify factors associated with cause-specific mortality (CSM). Results and limitations A total of 8185 patients were identified: NSR (n = 7811), RP (n = 245), and BT (n = 129). The 5-yr OS and predicted DSS were each significantly higher in patients undergoing RP (67.4{\%} and 75.8{\%}, respectively) or BT (52.6 and 61.3{\%}, respectively) compared with NSR patients (22.5{\%} and 48.7{\%}, respectively) (p {\textless} 0.001). Undergoing RP or BT was each independently associated with decreased CSM (p {\textless} 0.01). Similar results were noted regardless of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) M stage. Factors associated with increased CSM in patients undergoing local therapy included AJCC T4 stage, high-grade disease, prostate-specific antigen ≤20 ng/ml, age ≤70 yr, and pelvic lymphadenopathy (p {\textless} 0.05). The major limitation of this study was the lack of variables from SEER known to influence survival of patients with mPCa, including treatment with systemic therapy. Conclusions Definitive treatment of the prostate in men diagnosed with mPCa suggests a survival benefit in this large population-based study. These results should serve as a foundation for future prospective trials. Patient summary We used a large population-based cancer database to examine survival in men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) undergoing definitive therapy for the prostate. Local therapy (LT) appeared to confer a survival benefit. Therefore, we conclude that prospective trials are needed to further evaluate the role of LT in mPCa. {\textcopyright} 2013 European Association of Urology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Younger ages at diagnosis for blacks compared with whites have been reported for several cancer types. However, the US black population is younger than the white population, which may bias age comparisons that do not account for the populations at risk.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We analyzed Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data for non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites from 18 regions for the year 2010. We calculated crude mean ages at diagnosis among cases of 29 cancer types for whites and blacks. Separately, we calculated adjusted means that corrected for differences in population structure, which we obtained by fitting linear regression models to the ages at diagnosis with statistical weights specific to age and sex. Negative differences indicate younger ages in blacks, while positive differences indicate older ages in blacks. All statistical tests were two-sided.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Based on crude means, blacks were diagnosed at younger ages than whites for nearly every cancer type. However, adjustment for population structure shifted the comparisons toward older ages among blacks, and only six statistically significant differences of three or more years remained. Blacks were younger than whites at diagnosis for Kaposi sarcoma (-10.2 years), male soft tissue cancer (-5.6), male anal cancer (-5.5), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (-3.7), but older for cervical cancer (+4.7 years) and female thyroid cancer (+3.3). Smaller differences ({\textless}3 years) were present for female breast, female colon, lung, pancreas, prostate, and uterine corpus cancers (all P ≤ .001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Most differences between blacks and whites in the age at cancer diagnosis are small. Large differences for a few cancer types may be driven by etiologic and subtype heterogeneity as well as disparities in access to care.},

abstract = {Epidemiological, clinical, and molecular studies suggest a role for oestrogen in thyroid cancer. How oestrogen mediates its effects and the consequence of it on clinical outcome has not been fully elucidated. The participation of coregulatory proteins in modulating oestrogen receptor (ER) function and input of crosstalk with the tyrosine kinase receptor HER2 was investigated. Oestrogen induced cell proliferation in the follicular thyroid cancer (FTC)-133 cells, but not in the anaplastic 8305C cell line. Knockdown of the coactivator steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)-1 inhibited FTC-133 basal, but not oestrogen induced, cell proliferation. Oestrogen also increased protein expression of SRC-1 and the ER target gene cyclin D1 in the FTC-133 cell line. ERalpha, ERbeta, the coregulatory proteins SRC-1 and nuclear corepressor (NCoR), and the tyrosine kinase receptor HER2 were localised by immunohistochemistry and immnofluorescence in paraffin-embedded tissue from thyroid tumour patients (n=111). ERalpha was colocalised with both SRC-1 and NCoR to the nuclei of the tumour epithelial cells. Expression of ERalpha and NCoR was found predominantly in non-anaplastic tumours and was significantly associated with well-differentiated tumours and reduced incidence of disease recurrence. In non-anaplastic tumours, HER2 was significantly associated with SRC-1, and these proteins were associated with poorly differentiated tumours, capsular invasion and disease recurrence. Totally, 87{\%} of anaplastic tumours were positive for SRC-1. Kaplan-Meier estimates of disease-free survival indicated that in thyroid cancer, SRC-1 strongly correlates with reduced disease-free survival (P{\textless}0.001), whereas NCoR predicted increased survival (P{\textless}0.001). These data suggest opposing roles for the coregulators SRC-1 and NCoR in thyroid tumour progression.},

To identify additional genetic variants for ER-negative breast cancer, we conducted the largest meta-analysis of ER-negative disease to date, comprising 4754 ER-negative cases and 31 663 controls from three GWAS: NCI Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3) (2188 ER-negative cases; 25 519 controls of European ancestry), Triple Negative Breast Cancer Consortium (TNBCC) (1562 triple negative cases; 3399 controls of European ancestry) and African American Breast Cancer Consortium (AABC) (1004 ER-negative cases; 2745 controls). We performed in silico replication of 86 SNPs at P ≤ 1 × 10(-5) in an additional 11 209 breast cancer cases (946 with ER-negative disease) and 16 057 controls of Japanese, Latino and European ancestry. We identified two novel loci for breast cancer at 20q11 and 6q14. SNP rs2284378 at 20q11 was associated with ER-negative breast cancer (combined two-stage OR = 1.16; P = 1.1 × 10(-8)) but showed a weaker association with overall breast cancer (OR = 1.08, P = 1.3 × 10(-6)) based on 17 869 cases and 43 745 controls and no association with ER-positive disease (OR = 1.01, P = 0.67) based on 9965 cases and 22 902 controls. Similarly, rs17530068 at 6q14 was associated with breast cancer (OR = 1.12; P = 1.1 × 10(-9)), and with both ER-positive (OR = 1.09; P = 1.5 × 10(-5)) and ER-negative (OR = 1.16, P = 2.5 × 10(-7)) disease. We also confirmed three known loci associated with ER-negative (19p13) and both ER-negative and ER-positive breast cancer (6q25 and 12p11).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evaluations of epidemiologic risk factors in relation to breast cancer classified jointly by estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status have been inconsistent. To address this issue, we conducted a prospective evaluation of risk factors for breast cancer classified according to receptor status. METHODS: During 1 029 414 person-years of follow-up of 66 145 women participating in the Nurses' Health Study from 1980 through 2000, we identified 2096 incident cases of breast cancer for which information on ER/PR status was available: 1281 were ER+/PR+, 318 were ER+/PR-, 80 were ER-/PR+, and 417 were ER-/PR-. We fit a log-incidence model of breast cancer and used polychotomous logistic regression to compare coefficients for breast cancer risk factors in patients with different ER/PR status. To test for differences in risk factor odds ratios based on marginal ER/PR categories, we evaluated ER status controlling for PR status and vice versa. The predictive ability of our log-incidence model to discriminate between women who would develop ER+/PR+ breast cancer and those who would not (and similarly for ER-/PR- breast cancer) was evaluated by using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We observed statistically significant heterogeneity among the four ER/PR categories for some risk factors (age, menopausal status, body mass index [BMI] after menopause, the one-time adverse effect of first pregnancy, and past use of postmenopausal hormones) but not for others (benign breast disease, family history of breast cancer, alcohol use, and height). The one-time adverse association of first pregnancy with incidence was present for PR- but not for PR+ tumors after controlling for ER status (P =.007). However, the association of BMI after menopause with incidence was present for PR+ but not PR- tumors (P =.005). Statistically significant differences in the incidence of ER+ and ER- tumors were seen with age, both before and after menopause (P =.003), and with past use of postmenopausal hormones (P =.01). Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, adjusted for age, was 0.64 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 0.63 to 0.66) for ER+/PR+ tumors and 0.61 (95{\%} CI = 0.58 to 0.64) for ER-/PR- tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence rates and risk factors for breast cancer differ according to ER and PR status. Thus, to accurately estimate breast cancer risk, breast cancer cases should be divided according to the ER and PR status of the tumor.},

abstract = {Too many reports of associations between genetic variants and common cancer sites and other complex diseases are false positives. A major reason for this unfortunate situation is the strategy of declaring statistical significance based on a P value alone, particularly, any P value below .05. The false positive report probability (FPRP), the probability of no true association between a genetic variant and disease given a statistically significant finding, depends not only on the ob- served P value but also on both the prior probability that the association between the genetic variant and the disease is real and the statistical power of the test. In this commentary, we show how to assess the FPRP and how to use it to decide whether a finding is deserving of attention or “noteworthy.” We show how this approach can lead to improvements in the design, analysis, and interpretation of molecular epidemiology studies. Our proposal can help investigators, editors, and read- ers of research articles to protect themselves from overinter- preting statistically significant findings that are not likely to signify a true association. An FPRP-based criterion for decid- ing whether to call a finding noteworthy formalizes the process already used informally by investigators—that is, tempering enthusiasm for remarkable study findings with considerations of plausibility.},

abstract = {Hispanics living in the United States may face substantial adversity, given stresses of immigration and acculturation, low incomes, poor educational and occupational opportunities, inadequate access to health care, and exposure to discrimination. Despite these disadvantages, the Hispanic population often shows equal or better health outcomes when compared to non-Hispanic Whites, a trend that has puzzled researchers and has been referred to as the "Hispanic Paradox." Hispanics with non-U.S. nativity also tend to show better health than those born in the United States, although this advantage dissipates with increasing time spent in the United States. The current article discusses the Reserve Capacity Model (L.C. Gallo {\&} K. A. Matthews, 2003) as a potential framework for understanding how psychosocial risk and resilient factors may contribute to health disparities associated with broad sociocultural factors, such as low socioeconomic status or minority ethnicity. In addition, we examine theory concerning features of the Hispanic culture that may enhance resilience (e.g., social resources, familism, religiousness; G. Marin {\&} B. V. Marin, 1991) in the face of adverse circumstances. We summarize some of our recent work that has empirically tested effects of risk and resilient factors in Hispanic health in the contexts of prostate cancer and cardiovascular disease. We conclude by discussing future directions and opportunities for researchers interested in culture-specific resiliency factors in relation to health outcomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This article examines age at first drink and adult drinking, binge drinking and DSM-5 alcohol use disorder (AUD) among U.S. Hispanic national groups.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Respondents come from 2 independent studies. The Hispanic Americans Baseline Alcohol Survey used a multistage cluster sample design to interview 5,224 individuals 18 years of age and older selected from the household population in Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Houston, and Los Angeles. Respondents in the border area (N = 1,307) constituted a household probability sample of Mexican Americans living on U.S. counties that border Mexico. In both surveys, data were collected during computer-assisted interviews conducted in respondents' homes. The Hispanic American Baseline Alcohol Survey and the border sample response rates were 76 and 67{\%}, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: U.S.-born Hispanics begin drinking at a younger age than those who are foreign-born, independent of national group. Among foreign-born Hispanics, age of arrival in the United States is not associated with age at first drink. Results support the hypothesis that a younger age at first drink is associated with a higher mean volume of drinking, a higher probability of bingeing, and a higher probability of DSM-5 AUD. But the results do not show a clear pattern by which a particular national group would consistently show no associations or stronger associations between age at first drink and the alcohol-related outcomes under consideration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: An earlier age at first drinking is positively associated with heavier drinking patterns among U.S. Hispanics. However, as in other areas of alcohol epidemiology, here too there is considerable variation in age at first drink and drinking across Hispanic national groups.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies, which typically report regression coefficients summarizing the associations of many genetic variants with various traits, are potentially a powerful source of data for Mendelian randomization investigations. We demonstrate how such coefficients from multiple variants can be combined in a Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the causal effect of a risk factor on an outcome. The bias and efficiency of estimates based on summarized data are compared to those based on individual-level data in simulation studies. We investigate the impact of gene-gene interactions, linkage disequilibrium, and 'weak instruments' on these estimates. Both an inverse-variance weighted average of variant-specific associations and a likelihood-based approach for summarized data give similar estimates and precision to the two-stage least squares method for individual-level data, even when there are gene-gene interactions. However, these summarized data methods overstate precision when variants are in linkage disequilibrium. If the P-value in a linear regression of the risk factor for each variant is less than 1×10⁻⁵, then weak instrument bias will be small. We use these methods to estimate the causal association of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on coronary artery disease using published data on five genetic variants. A 30{\%} reduction in LDL-C is estimated to reduce coronary artery disease risk by 67{\%} (95{\%} CI: 54{\%} to 76{\%}). We conclude that Mendelian randomization investigations using summarized data from uncorrelated variants are similarly efficient to those using individual-level data, although the necessary assumptions cannot be so fully assessed.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies regarding the association between red and processed meat intake and the risk of breast cancer have yielded inconsistent results. Therefore, we conducted an updated and comprehensive meta-analysis which included 14 prospective studies to evaluate the association of red and processed meat intake with breast cancer risk. Relevant prospective cohort studies were identified by searching PubMed through October 31, 2014, and by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved articles. Study-specific relative risk (RR) estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. Fourteen prospective studies on red meat (involving 31,552 cases) and 12 prospective studies on processed meat were included in the meta-analysis. The summary RRs (95 {\%} CI) of breast cancer for the highest versus the lowest categories were 1.10 (1.02, 1.19) for red meat, and 1.08 (1.01, 1.15) for processed meat. The estimated summary RRs (95 {\%} CI) were 1.11 (1.05, 1.16) for an increase of 120 g/day of red meat, and 1.09 (1.03, 1.16) for an increase of 50 g/day of processed meat. Our findings indicate that increased intake of red and processed meat is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Further research with well-designed cohort or interventional studies is needed to confirm the association.},

abstract = {Background: This study investigated whether definitive local therapy [radical prostatectomy (RP) or brachytherapy (BT)] of the primary tumor improves survival in men with metastatic prostate cancer (PrCA) at diagnosis. Methods: Data on newly diagnosed metastatic PrCA cases (stage IV, N= 7858) were obtained from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. Conventional multivariable survival analysis and propensity score analysis were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI) comparing men who underwent definitive local therapy of the primary tumor to those who did not. Results: After adjusting for sociodemographic and tumor attributes, having RP after diagnosis with metastatic PrCA was associated with 73{\%} (HR. = 0.27, 95{\%} CI: 0.20-0.38) lower risk of all-cause mortality and 72{\%} (HR. = 0.28, 95{\%} CI: 0.20-0.39) reduced risk of death from PrCA. Having BT also was associated with 57{\%} (HR. = 0.43, 95{\%} CI: 0.31-0.59) and 54{\%} (HR. = 0.46, 95{\%} CI: 0.33-0.64) lower risk of all-cause and PrCA-specific mortality. Similar results were observed in propensity score-adjusted analysis as well as when stratified by age and extent of tumor metastasis. Conclusions: These findings suggest that definitive local therapy improves survival in men with metastatic PrCA at diagnosis.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the association between adult diet and breast cancer has been investigated extensively, large prospective studies have generally not shown a direct link between intakes of carbohydrate, fat, fiber, and other nutrients and risk of breast cancer. Adolescence may be a period of increased susceptibility to risk factors that predispose to breast cancer. Dietary risk factors could therefore be more important during early life than later in adulthood.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This is a prospective observational study of 39,268 premenopausal women in the Nurses' Health Study II who completed a 124-item food frequency questionnaire on their diet during high school (HS-FFQ) in 1998, at which time participants were 34 to 53 years of age. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate relative risks and 95{\%} CIs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Four hundred fifty-five incident cases of invasive breast cancer were diagnosed between 1998 and 2005. Compared with women in the lowest quintile of intake, the relative risk of breast cancer in the highest quintile of adolescent total fat consumption was 1.35 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.00-1.81). Adolescent consumption of saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans fats was not significantly associated with breast cancer risk. Total dairy, milk, carbohydrate intake, glycemic index, glycemic load, and fiber consumed during adolescence were not significantly related to breast cancer incidence.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Dietary fat consumed during adolescence may be associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer. Further studies to assess this relationship among postmenopausal women, and confirm these results in premenopausal women, are needed.},

In this paper we assess gene expression patterns with SNPs in genes in the CHIEF pathway to help determine their potential functionality.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was run to determine gene expression of 13 genes in normal colon tissue samples from 82 individuals. TagSNP genotype data were obtained from a GoldenGate Illumina multiplex bead array platform. Age, sex, and genetic ancestry adjusted general linear models were used to estimate beta coefficients and p values.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Genetic variation in mTOR (1 SNP), NFKB1 (4 SNPs), PRKAG2 (3 SNPs), and TSC2 (1 SNP) significantly influenced their expression. After adjustment for multiple comparisons several associations between pathway genes and expression of other genes were significant. These included AKT1 rs1130214 associated with expression of PDK1; NF$\kappa$B1 rs13117745 and rs4648110 with STK11 expression; PRKAG2 rs6965771 with expression of NF$\kappa$B1, PIK3CA, and RPS6KB2; RPS6KB1 rs80711475 with STK11 expression; STK11 rs741765 with PIK3CA and PRKAG2 expression; and TSC2 rs3087631 with AKT1, IkB$\kappa$B, NF$\kappa$B1, PDK1, PIK3CA, PRKAG2, and PTEN expression. The higher levels of differential expression were noted for TSC2 rs3087631 (percent difference ranges from 108{\%} to 198{\%} across genes). Many of these SNPs and genes also were associated with colon and rectal cancer risk.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that pathway genes may regulate expression of other genes in the pathway. The convergence of these genes in several biological pathways involved in cancer further supports their importance to the carcinogenic process.},

abstract = {Previous studies of the association of meat intake and meat-derived mutagen exposure with breast cancer risk have produced inconsistent results. We evaluated this association in a population-based case-control study of incident breast cancer conducted in Nashville, Tennessee, United States, including 2,386 breast cancer cases and 1,703 healthy women controls. Telephone interviews were conducted to obtain information related to meat intake including amount, cooking methods, and doneness levels, as well as other known or hypothesized risk factors for breast cancer. Unconditional logistic regression was used to derive odds ratios (ORs) after adjusting for potential confounders. High intake of red meat was associated with a significantly elevated risk of breast cancer (P-trend {\textless} 0.001). The association was particularly strong for high intake of well-done red meat (P-trend {\textless} 0.001), with an adjusted OR of 1.5 (95{\%} CI = 1.3-1.9) for the highest versus the lowest quartile. Associations between red meat and breast cancer risk were slightly stronger for postmenopausal women than for premenopausal women. Meat-derived mutagens such as 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline and 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, were significantly associated with increased breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women only (P-trend = 0.002 and 0.003, respectively). The results from this study provide strong support for the hypotheses that high red meat intake and meat-derived mutagen exposure may be associated with an increase in breast cancer risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of well-done meat intake and meat-derived mutagen heterocyclic amine (HCA) exposure in the risk of colorectal neoplasm has been suggested but not yet established. OBJECTIVE: With the use of gene-environment interaction analyses, we sought to clarify the association of HCA exposure with colorectal polyp risk. DESIGN: In a case-control study including 2057 colorectal polyp patients and 3329 controls, we evaluated 16 functional genetic variants to construct an HCA-metabolizing score. To derive dietary HCA-exposure amount, data were collected regarding dietary intake of meat by cooking method and degree of doneness. RESULTS: A 2-fold elevated risk associated with high red meat intake was found for colorectal polyps or adenomas in subjects with a high HCA-metabolizing risk score, whereas the risk was 1.3- to 1.4-fold among those with a low risk score (P-interaction {\textless}/= 0.05). The interaction was stronger for the risk of advanced or multiple adenomas, in which an OR of 2.8 (95{\%} CI: 1.8, 4.6) was observed for those with both a high HCA-risk score and high red meat intake (P-interaction = 0.01). No statistically significant interaction was found in analyses that used specific HCA exposure derived from dietary data. CONCLUSION: High red meat intake is associated with an elevated risk of colorectal polyps, and this association may be synergistically modified by genetic factors involved in HCA metabolism.},

abstract = {One goal in the post-genome-wide association study era is characterizing gene-environment interactions, including scanning for interactions with all available polymorphisms, not just those showing significant main effects. In recent years, several approaches to such "gene-environment-wide interaction studies" have been proposed. Two contributions in this issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology provide systematic comparisons of the performance of these various approaches, one based on simulation and one based on application to 2 real genome-wide association study scans for type 2 diabetes. The authors discuss some of the broader issues raised by these contributions, including the plausibility of the gene-environment independence assumption that some of these approaches rely upon, the need for replication, and various generalizations of these approaches.},

abstract = {Epidemiological evidence of red meat and processed meat consumption and colorectal cancer risk has accumulated during the past decades. Meta-analyses of case-control and prospective cohort studies have shown a moderate increased risk, but the association is controversial. Because diet is one of the modifiable lifestyle factors for colorectal cancer prevention, the relationship has an important public health perspective. Three prospective cohort studies and one case-control study of total red meat and processed meat and colorectal cancer were published in 2011 and 2012. The findings were in general supportive of an increased risk with higher consumption. The same applies to the four studies each on fresh red meat and processed meat. Associations with dietary heterocyclic amines, nitroso-compounds, and heme iron intake are inconsistent, but evidence suggested a positive association between heme iron intake and colorectal cancer risk.},

abstract = {By characterizing the geographic and functional spectrum of human genetic variation, the 1000 Genomes Project aims to build a resource to help to understand the genetic contribution to disease. Here we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methods to integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource, which captures up to 98{\%} of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1{\%} in related populations, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In this paper, we address the questions: how large a sample size would be required to show genome-wide significance between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and a genetic trait in a meta-analysis of a newly planned study together with the existing ones? Or alternatively: will a planned study of size n be able to provide evidence of a genetic association when this study is combined with a current meta-analysis? METHODS: We examine the potential impact of a newly planned genetic study on an existing meta-analysis through the use of a simulation-based algorithm. The proposed approach provides an empirical estimate of the power of the updated meta-analysis to detect genome-wide significance (p{\textless}5.0x10(-8)) of a complex trait and each of a set of specific SNPs of interest or the expected p value of the updated meta-analysis including the current and proposed studies. RESULTS: This technique is illustrated in the context of an updated meta-analysis of case-control studies in Paget's disease. A second example illustrates the impact of adding a newly planned study to a large meta-analysis of SNP associations with human height. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed algorithm is particularly useful for the design of studies to assess a selected set of high-priority SNP associations that are 'nearly' significant in meta-analysis of existing studies. The results may help investigators decide whether an updated meta-analysis is likely to achieve genome-wide significance.},

abstract = {To investigate the familial aggregation of colorectal cancer in Denmark, parents and siblings of colorectal cancer patients diagnosed below age 60 years in the years 1982-1984 were identified through population registries. For 1,470 probands with families eligible for tracing, 1,376 mothers, 1,303 fathers and 3,259 siblings were identified. They contributed 222,634 person-years, and 325 cases of colorectal cancer were observed during the follow-up period 1943-1992. All data were retrieved from population registries and consequently were free from any reporting bias. The overall standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) compared with the Danish population was 2.02 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.81-2.25), significantly different between the parents (1.78, 95{\%} CI 1.55-2.04) and the siblings (2.65, 95{\%} CI 2.21-3.17). A strong dependence on the proband's age at diagnosis was seen for the sibling risk; siblings of probands less than 50 years old at diagnosis had a 5-fold risk compared with the general population. This dependence was not seen for parents, but the risk tended to be higher for parents of younger ages. No other factor was seen to influence the relative risk. The observation of an 80{\%} increased risk among the parents and a 170{\%} increased risk among the siblings indicates that the genetic component is one source, but probably not the only one, of familial aggregation of colorectal cancer. The cost benefit of screening siblings of colorectal cancer patients is substantially higher than that for the total population.},

abstract = {Animal experiments and human ecological studies suggest that dietary fat intake is associated with a risk of breast cancer, but individual-based studies have given contradictory results. We have carried out a meta-analysis of this association to include all papers published up to July 2003. Case-control and cohort studies that examined the association of dietary fat, or fat-containing foods, with risk of breast cancer were identified. A total of 45 risk estimates for total fat intake were obtained. Descriptive data from each study were extracted with an estimate of relative risk and its associated 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), and were analysed using the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird. The summary relative risk, comparing the highest and lowest levels of intake of total fat, was 1.13 (95{\%} CI: 1.03-1.25). Cohort studies (N=14) had a summary relative risk of 1.11 (95{\%} CI: 0.99-1.25) and case-control studies (N=31) had a relative risk of 1.14 (95{\%} CI 0.99-1.32). Significant summary relative risks were also found for saturated fat (RR, 1.19; 95{\%} CI: 1.06-1.35) and meat intake (RR, 1.17; 95{\%} CI 1.06-1.29). Combined estimates of risk for total and saturated fat intake, and for meat intake, all indicate an association between higher intakes and an increased risk of breast cancer. Case-control and cohort studies gave similar results.},

abstract = {A recent study observed a survival benefit in men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) and managed with local treatment of the primary tumor (LT; either radical prostatectomy plus pelvic lymph node dissection or radiation therapy). We tested the hypothesis that only specific mPCa patients would benefit from LT and that the potential benefit would vary based on primary tumor characteristics. A total of 8197 mPCa patients at diagnosis (M1a, M1b, and M1c) were identified using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database (2004-2011) and were divided according to treatment type: LT versus nonlocal treatment of the primary tumor (NLT; either androgen deprivation therapy or observation). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to predict cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in patients that received NLT. To assess whether the benefit of LT was different by baseline risk, we tested an interaction with CSM risk and LT. At multivariable analysis, all predictors were significantly associated with CSM, and the interaction test was statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.0001). Local treatment of the primary tumor, compared with NLT, conferred a higher CSM-free survival rate in patients with a predicted CSM risk {\textless}40{\%}. The number needed to treat according to the predicted CSM risk at 3 yr after diagnosis remained substantially constant from 10{\%} to 30{\%}, whereas it exponentially increased for predicted CSM risk {\textgreater}40{\%}. These results should serve as a foundation for future prospective trials. Patient summary Among metastatic prostate cancer patients, the potential benefit of local treatment to the primary tumor depends greatly on tumor characteristics, and patient selection is essential to avoid either over- or undertreatment.},

In 2012, an estimated 112,800 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed and 33,200 cancer deaths will occur among Hispanics. In 2009, the most recent year for which actual data are available, cancer surpassed heart disease as the leading cause of death among Hispanics. Among US Hispanics during the past 10 years of available data (2000-2009), cancer incidence rates declined by 1.7{\%} per year among men and 0.3{\%} per year among women, while cancer death rates declined by 2.3{\%} per year in men and 1.4{\%} per year in women. Hispanics have lower incidence and death rates than non-Hispanic whites for all cancers combined and for the 4 most common cancers (breast, prostate, lung and bronchus, and colorectum). However, Hispanics have higher incidence and mortality rates for cancers of the stomach, liver, uterine cervix, and gallbladder, reflecting greater exposure to cancer-causing infectious agents, lower rates of screening for cervical cancer, differences in lifestyle and die- tary patterns, and possibly genetic factors. Strategies for reducing cancer risk among Hispanics include increasing utilization of screening and available vaccines, as well as implementing effective interventions to reduce obesity, alcohol consumption, and tobacco use.},

abstract = {Multiple epidemiological studies have evaluated the relationship between diet and gastric cancer (GC), focusing on individual foods and nutrients. However, some studies have estimated the association between dietary patterns and GC risk. To identify the dietary patterns of residents of Mexico City and to assess the association of these patterns with GC, a population-based case-control study with 248 histologically confirmed GC cases and 478 controls paired by age and sex was carried out. The dietary patterns were characterized from 22 food groups through factorial analysis. Three major dietary patterns were identified. Pattern 1 was characterized by the consumption of vegetables, fruits, and white meat; subjects in the highest quintile of this pattern had a lower GC risk than those in the lowest quintile [odds ratio (OR(Q5 vs. Q1)) = 0.43; 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%}CI): 0.24-0.77; P trend = 0.010]. A comparison between the extreme quintiles of the third pattern (which included major consumption of refined grains and desserts), resulted in the following: OR(Q5 vs. Q1) = 4.80; 95{\%}CI: 2.56-8.98; P-trend {\textless} 0.001). Additionally, we found no significant association between the second pattern (characterized by high consumption of Mexican food) and GC risk. This is the first study of associations between dietary patterns and GC in Mexico to confirm that GC risk is lower in individuals with healthy dietary patterns.},

intake and breast cancer (BC) risk. Few studies included Hispanic women.
We investigated the association between meats and fish intake and BC
risk among Hispanic and NHW women.
The study included NHW (1,982 cases and 2,218 controls) and the US
Hispanics (1,777 cases and 2,218 controls) from two population-based
case-control studies. Analyses considered menopausal status and percent
Native American ancestry. We estimated pooled ORs combining harmonized
data from both studies, and study- and race-/ethnicity-specific ORs that
were combined using fixed or random effects models, depending on
heterogeneity levels.
When comparing highest versus lowest tertile of intake, among NHW we
observed an association between tuna intake and BC risk (pooled OR 1.25;
95 {\%} CI 1.05-1.50; trend p = 0.006). Among Hispanics, we observed an
association between BC risk and processed meat intake (pooled OR 1.42;
95 {\%} CI 1.18-1.71; trend p {\textless} 0.001), and between white meat (OR 0.80;
95 {\%} CI 0.67-0.95; trend p = 0.01) and BC risk, driven by poultry. All
these findings were supported by meta-analysis using fixed or random
effect models and were restricted to estrogen receptor-positive tumors.
Processed meats and poultry were not associated with BC risk among NHW
women; red meat and fish were not associated with BC risk in either
race/ethnic groups.
Our results suggest the presence of ethnic differences in associations
between meat and BC risk that may contribute to BC disparities.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence and predictors of complications after prostate brachytherapy in a population-based sample of older men. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed claims for Medicare-enrolled men older than age 65 years living in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) surveillance areas diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1991 to 1999 who underwent brachytherapy as initial treatment. RESULTS: There were 5,621 men who had brachytherapy with at least 2 years of follow-up. A complication diagnosis or invasive procedure occurred in 54.5{\%} of men within 2 years, with 14.1{\%} undergoing an invasive procedure. Urinary, bowel, and erectile morbidity rates were 33.8{\%}, 21.0{\%}, and 16.7{\%}, respectively, and invasive procedure rates were 10.3{\%}, 0.8{\%}, and 4.0{\%}, respectively. On multivariable analysis, combined urinary diagnoses and invasive procedures (obstruction, incontinence, bleeding, fistula) were associated with older age (P {\textless} .01), nonwhite race (odds ratio [OR], 1.30; P = .01), low income (OR, 1.74; P {\textless} .01), external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT; OR, 0.85; P = .01), androgen deprivation (OR, 1.31; P {\textless} .01), later year of brachytherapy (OR, 1.03/yr; P = .02), higher Charlson comorbidity score (P {\textless} .01), and prior transurethral resection of the prostate (OR, 1.65; P {\textless} .01). Bowel morbidity (bleeding/proctitis, injury) was associated with older age (P = .04), EBRT (OR, 1.46; P {\textless} .01), later year (OR, 1.04/yr; P {\textless} .01), higher Charlson score (P = .01), and inflammatory bowel disease (OR, 2.60; P {\textless} .01). Erectile morbidity was associated with younger age (P {\textless} .01), nonwhite race (OR, 1.37; P {\textless} .01), AD (OR, 1.18; P = .04), and later year (OR, 1.08/yr; P {\textless} .01). Invasive procedure rates declined with later year of brachytherapy (OR, 0.93/yr; P {\textless} .01). CONCLUSION: Morbidity after prostate brachytherapy was common, though invasive procedures were required infrequently. Invasive procedures for complications declined during the 1990s, suggesting technical improvement with experience.},

abstract = {Purpose: There is little evidence comparing complications after intensity-modulated (IMRT) vs. three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (CRT) for prostate cancer. The study objective was to test the hypothesis that IMRT, compared with CRT, is associated with a reduction in bowel, urinary, and erectile complications in elderly men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Methods and Materials: We undertook an observational cohort study using registry and administrative claims data from the SEER-Medicare database. We identified men aged 65 years or older diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the United States between 2002 and 2004 who received IMRT (n = 5,845) or CRT (n = 6,753). The primary outcome was a composite measure of bowel complications. Secondary outcomes were composite measures of urinary and erectile complications. We also examined specific subsets of bowel (proctitis/hemorrhage) and urinary (cystitis/hematuria) events within the composite complication measures. Results: IMRT was associated with reductions in composite bowel complications (24-month cumulative incidence 18.8{\%} vs. 22.5{\%}; hazard ratio [HR] 0.86; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.93) and proctitis/hemorrhage (HR 0.78; 95{\%} CI, 0.64-0.95). IMRT was not associated with rates of composite urinary complications (HR 0.93; 95{\%} CI, 0.83-1.04) or cystitis/hematuria (HR 0.94; 95{\%} CI, 0.83-1.07). The incidence of erectile complications involving invasive procedures was low and did not differ significantly between groups, although IMRT was associated with an increase in new diagnoses of impotence (HR 1.27, 95{\%} CI, 1.14-1.42). Conclusion: IMRT is associated with a small reduction in composite bowel complications and proctitis/hemorrhage compared with CRT in elderly men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background: More than 1000 reports have been published in the past two decades on associations between variants in candidate genes and risk of breast cancer. Results have been generally inconsistent. We did a literature search and meta-analyses to provide a synopsis of the current understanding of the genetic architecture of breast-cancer risk. Methods: A systematic literature search for candidate-gene association studies of breast-cancer risk was done in two stages, using PubMed on or before Feb 28, 2010. A total of 24 500 publications were identified, of which 1059 were deemed eligible for inclusion. Meta-analyses were done for 279 genetic variants in 128 candidate genes or chromosomal loci that had at least three data sources. Variants with significant associations by meta-analysis were assessed using the Venice criteria and scored as having strong, moderate, or weak cumulative evidence for an association with breast-cancer risk. Findings: 51 variants in 40 genes showed significant associations with breast-cancer risk. Cumulative epidemiological evidence of an association was graded as strong for ten variants in six genes (ATM, CASP8, CHEK2, CTLA4, NBN, and TP53), moderate for four variants in four genes (ATM, CYP19A1, TERT, and XRCC3), and weak for 37 variants. Additionally, in meta-analyses that included a minimum of 10 000 cases and 10 000 controls, convincing evidence of no association with breast-cancer risk was identified for 45 variants in 37 genes. Interpretation: Whereas most genetic variants assessed in previous candidate-gene studies showed no association with breast-cancer risk in meta-analyses, 14 variants in nine genes had moderate to strong evidence for an association. Further evaluation of these variants is warranted. Funding: US National Cancer Institute. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The NF$\kappa$B-signaling pathway regulates cell proliferation and inflammation. Activation of the pathway is implicated in the etiology of colorectal cancer (CRC). NSAIDs may reduce CRC risk partially through a nuclear factor-kappa B (NF$\kappa$B)-dependent pathway. In this study, we investigated associations between 34 NF$\kappa$B1 and 8 I$\kappa$BK$\beta$ tagSNPs and CRC risk and examined interactions with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Using conditional logistic regression, we investigated these associations among 1584 incident CRC cases and 2516 sibling controls from the Colon Cancer Family Registry. Three I$\kappa$BK$\beta$ SNPs were associated with a statistically significant lower colorectal or colon cancer risk: rs9694958 (A{\textgreater}G intron 5) (colorectal: OR(hzv) = 0.26(0.07-0.99), P(trend) = 0.048, P(adj) = 0.25), rs10958713 (A{\textgreater}C intron 19) (colon: OR(hzv) = 0.62(0.42-0.92), P(trend) = 0.005, P(adj) = 0.03) and rs5029748 (C{\textgreater}A intron 2) (colon: OR(het) = 0.72(0.56-0.91), P(trend) = 0.01, P(adj) = 0.08).

I$\kappa$BK$\beta$'s rs6474387 (C{\textgreater}T intron 20) and rs11986055 (A{\textgreater}C intron 2) showed substantially lower colon cancer risk among current NSAID users (P(interaction) = 0.01 and P(interaction) = 0.045, respectively), whereas NF$\kappa$B1's rs230490 (G{\textgreater}A 5' (outside UTR)) and rs997476 (C{\textgreater}A 3' (outside UTR)) showed higher CRC risk among current NSAID users (P(interaction) = 0.01 and P(interaction) = 0.03, respectively). These findings suggest that variants in NF$\kappa$B1 and I$\kappa$BK$\beta$ are associated with CRC risk and NSAIDs may function partially through an NF$\kappa$B-dependent pathway. The SNPs identified here should be considered for future functional studies and may be useful in designing a pharmacogenetic approach to preventive NSAID use.},

abstract = {There are abundant data and advisories for mercury levels in wild fish, but far fewer for commercial fish that compose a large majority of the fish most people eat. Until recently, relatively little attention has been devoted to examining mercury in canned tuna, despite its great importance in human diets. There is substantial media coverage of the benefits and risk from fish consumption, but few peer-reviewed data on canned tuna, the most commonly consumed fish in the United States. In this paper, we examine the levels of total mercury in canned tuna obtained from a New Jersey grocery store from 1998 to 2003, looking for temporal consistency within this data set and particularly for comparison with the Food and Drug Administration's 1991 study. We analyzed 168 cans individually for total mercury. All values are reported as parts per million (=$\mu$g/g) on a wet weight basis. In a subset of samples analyzed for total and inorganic mercury, the inorganic mercury was below detection levels; hence at least 89{\%} of the mercury can be considered methylmercury. We found that white-style tuna had significantly more total mercury (mean 0.407ppm) than light-style tuna (mean 0.118ppm), presumably reflecting that "white" tuna is albacore, a species relatively larger than the skipjack tuna, which is commonly available as "light" or "chunk light." The maximum mercury in a can was 0.997ppm, but 25{\%} of white tuna samples exceeded 0.5ppm. Data suggest a slight increase in levels since 1991, and mercury levels were significantly higher in 2001 than in other years. The mean level of mercury in white tuna (mean 0.407ppm) was significantly higher than the mean value of 0.17ppm currently used by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in its risk assessment and public information. There were no significant differences in mercury levels in tuna packed in oil compared to water. Draining contents had no effect on mercury levels, and the fluid, both oil and water, contained little mercury. These data indicate that people who eat canned tuna frequently can choose light tuna and reduce their mercury intake. Canned mackerel had much lower levels of mercury than tuna. Since cans of white tuna frequently exceed the FDA's original action level of 0.5ppm, it would be prudent to continue some systematic monitoring of the nation's canned fish supply, particularly as the targets of commercial fisheries inevitably change as certain stocks become depleted. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Heterocyclic amines (HCAs) are mutagenic compounds generated when meats are cooked at high temperature and for long duration. The findings from previous studies on the relation between HCAs and breast cancer are inconsistent, possibly because of genetic variations in the enzymes metabolizing HCAs. To evaluate whether the associations of intakes of estimated HCAs, meat-derived mutagenicity (MDM), and red meat with risk of postmenopausal breast cancer were modified by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) acetylator genotype or cytochrome P450 1A2-164 A/C (CYP1A2) polymorphism, we conducted a nested case-control study with 579 cases and 981 controls within a prospective cohort, the Nurses' Health Study. HCAs and MDM intakes were derived using a cooking method questionnaire administered in 1996. NAT2acetylator genotype, the CYP1A2 polymorphism, and intakes of HCAs, MDM, and red meat were not associated with risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. There was also no interaction between NAT2 acetylator genotype or CYP1A2 polymorphism and HCAs and MDM and red meat intake in relation to breast cancer. These results do not support the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms of xenobiotic enzymes involved in the metabolism of HCAs may modify the associations between intakes of red meat or meat-related mutagens and breast cancer risk.},

abstract = {Genotype imputation, used in genome-wide association studies to expand coverage of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), has performed poorly in African Americans compared to less admixed populations. Overall, imputation has typically relied on HapMap reference haplotype panels from Africans (YRI), European Americans (CEU), and Asians (CHB/JPT). The 1000 Genomes project offers a wider range of reference populations, such as African Americans (ASW), but their imputation performance has had limited evaluation. Using 595 African Americans genotyped on Illumina's HumanHap550v3 BeadChip, we compared imputation results from four software programs (IMPUTE2, BEAGLE, MaCH, and MaCH-Admix) and three reference panels consisting of different combinations of 1000 Genomes populations (February 2012 release): (1) 3 specifically selected populations (YRI, CEU, and ASW); (2) 8 populations of diverse African (AFR) or European (AFR) descent; and (3) all 14 available populations (ALL). Based on chromosome 22, we calculated three performance metrics: (1) concordance (percentage of masked genotyped SNPs with imputed and true genotype agreement); (2) imputation quality score (IQS; concordance adjusted for chance agreement, which is particularly informative for low minor allele frequency [MAF] SNPs); and (3) average r2hat (estimated correlation between the imputed and true genotypes, for all imputed SNPs). Across the reference panels, IMPUTE2 and MaCH had the highest concordance (91{\%}-93{\%}), but IMPUTE2 had the highest IQS (81{\%}-83{\%}) and average r2hat (0.68 using YRI+ASW+CEU, 0.62 using AFR+EUR, and 0.55 using ALL). Imputation quality for most programs was reduced by the addition of more distantly related reference populations, due entirely to the introduction of low frequency SNPs (MAF≤2{\%}) that are monomorphic in the more closely related panels. While imputation was optimized by using IMPUTE2 with reference to the ALL panel (average r2hat = 0.86 for SNPs with MAF{\textgreater}2{\%}), use of the ALL panel for African American studies requires careful interpretation of the population specificity and imputation quality of low frequency SNPs.},

We found that increased numbers of IL-17-producing cells were correlated with high histological grade, negative ER/PR status, and triple-negative molecular subtypes segregated by immunoprofiles. However, they did not correlate with stage, tumour size, nodal status, HER2 status, or histological type.

abstract = {Intake of calcium and/or dairy products has been associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in some epidemiological studies. One potential biological mechanism is that high calcium intake down-regulates 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D(3), which may increase cell proliferation in the prostate. We examined the association between calcium, dairy intake, and prostate cancer incidence in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, a prospective cohort of elderly United States adults. Participants in the study completed a detailed questionnaire on diet, medical history, and lifestyle at enrollment in 1992-1993. After excluding men with a history of cancer or incomplete dietary information, 65,321 men remained for analysis. During follow-up through August 31, 1999, we documented 3811 cases of incident prostate cancer. Multivariate-adjusted rate ratios (RRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. Total calcium intake (from diet and supplements) was associated with modestly increased risk of prostate cancer [RR = 1.2, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 1.0-1.6 for {\textgreater}or=2000 versus {\textless}700 mg/day, P trend = 0.02). High dietary calcium intake ({\textgreater}or=2000 versus {\textless}700 mg/day) was also associated with increased risk of prostate cancer (RR = 1.6, 95{\%} CI = 1.1-2.3, P trend = 0.10), although moderate levels of dietary calcium were not associated with increased risk. Dairy intake was not associated with prostate cancer risk. The association between prostate cancer and total calcium intake was strongest for men who reported not having prostate-specific antigen testing before 1992 (RR = 1.5, 95{\%} CI = 1.1-2.0, P trend {\textless} 0.01 for {\textgreater}or= 2000 mg/day of total calcium; RR = 2.1, 95{\%} CI = 1.3-3.4 {\textgreater}or=2000 mg/day of dietary calcium, P trend = 0.04). Our results support the hypothesis that very high calcium intake, above the recommended intake for men, may modestly increase risk of prostate cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In studies of all-cause mortality, the fundamental epidemiological concepts of rate and risk are connected through a well-defined one-to-one relation. An important consequence of this relation is that regression models such as the proportional hazards model that are defined through the hazard (the rate) immediately dictate how the covariates relate to the survival function (the risk).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This introductory paper reviews the concepts of rate and risk and their one-to-one relation in all-cause mortality studies and introduces the analogous concepts of rate and risk in the context of competing risks, the cause-specific hazard and the cause-specific cumulative incidence function.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The key feature of competing risks is that the one-to-one correspondence between cause-specific hazard and cumulative incidence, between rate and risk, is lost. This fact has two important implications. First, the na{\"{i}}ve Kaplan-Meier that takes the competing events as censored observations, is biased. Secondly, the way in which covariates are associated with the cause-specific hazards may not coincide with the way these covariates are associated with the cumulative incidence. An example with relapse and non-relapse mortality as competing risks in a stem cell transplantation study is used for illustration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The two implications of the loss of one-to-one correspondence between cause-specific hazard and cumulative incidence should be kept in mind when deciding on how to make inference in a competing risks situation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is one of the most common inherited disorders predisposing to cancer. The genes responsible for the disease have recently been cloned and characterised; their mutations induce a generalised genomic instability which is particularly evident at microsatellite loci (replication error (RER)+ phenotype). AIMS: To investigate how to select individuals and families in the general population who should be screened for constitutional mutations predisposing to colorectal cancer. PATIENTS/METHODS: Between 1984 and 1995, 1899 colorectal malignancies in 1831 patients were registered, and in 1721 of these (94{\%}), family trees could be obtained. Patients and families were classified into five categories according to a more or less likely genetic basis: HNPCC; "suspected" HNPCC; juvenile cases; aspecific cancer aggregation; sporadic cases. In 18 families with HNPCC as well as in 18 with suspected HNPCC, microsatellite instability in tumour tissues and constitutional mutations of two DNA mismatch repair genes (MSH2 and MLH1) could be evaluated. RER status was studied with five markers (BAT40, D2S123, D18S57, D17S787, and BAT26) in paraffin embedded tissues. Germline mutations of MSH2 or MLH1 genes were assessed on DNA and RNA extracted from lymphomonocytic cells, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: HNPCC represented 2.6{\%} and suspected HNPCC 4.6{\%} of all registered colorectal neoplasms. Eleven out of 18 HNPCC families (61{\%}) showed microsatellite instability as opposed to four (of 18) suspected HNPCC (22{\%}; p{\textless}0.02). Three germline mutations (two in MSH2 and one in MLH1 gene) were found in three different large HNPCC families, whereas no mutations were detected in suspected HNPCC. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of cancer genetic epidemiology, data from a tumour registry were analysed and this ultimately led to the identification and selection of families that should be tested for mutator gene mutations. With the use of a population based approach, the incidence of mutations was appreciably lower than previously reported and limited to families with full blown HNPCC. It is possible that in most families with a clinical spectrum of HNPCC (or suspected HNPCC) other DNA mismatch repair genes are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.},

During a median follow-up period of 12.4 years, 456 diabetes cases were confirmed. Intake of red meat, processed meat, and poultry was derived from a food frequency questionnaire, and their association with serum high-sensitivity CRP was examined cross-sectionally using linear regression models. Their association with risk of type 2 diabetes was examined using multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, including age, sex, family history of diabetes, and lifestyle and dietary factors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: An increment of 50 g of processed meat was associated with increased CRP concentration ($\beta$(processed meat) = 0.12; P = 0.01), whereas intake of red meat and poultry was not. When comparing the highest to the lowest category of meat intake with respect to diabetes incidence, the adjusted relative risks were as follows: for red meat (1.42 [95{\%} CI 1.06-1.91]), for processed meat (1.87 [1.26-2.78]), and for poultry (0.95 [0.74-1.22]). Additional analysis showed that the associations were not affected appreciably after inclusion of CRP into the model. After adjustment for BMI, however, the association for red meat attenuated to 1.18 (0.88-1.59).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Intake of processed meat is associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes.

abstract = {Population-based genetic association studies have proven to be a powerful tool in identifying genes implicated in many complex human diseases that have a huge impact on public health. An essential quality control step in such studies is to undertake Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) calculations. Deviations from HWE in the control group may reflect important problems including selection bias, population stratification and genotyping errors. If HWE is violated, the inferences of these studies may thus be biased. We therefore aimed to examine the extent to which HWE calculations are reported in genetic association studies published in Cell Journal(Yakhteh)(Cell J). Using keywords pertaining to genetic association studies, eleven relevant articles were identified of which ten provided full genotypic data. The genotype distribution of 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was re-analyzed for HWE by using three different methods where appropriate. HWE was not reported in 60{\%} of all articles investigated. Among those reporting, only one article provided calculations correctly and in detail. Therefore, 90{\%} of articles analyzed failed to provide sufficient HWE data. Interestingly, three articles had significant HWE deviation in their control groups of which one highly deviated from HWE expectations (P= 9.8×10(-12)). We thus show that HWE calculations are under-reported in genetic association studies published in this journal. Furthermore, the conclusions of the three studies showing significant HWE in their control groups should be treated cautiously as they may be potentially misleading. We therefore recommend that reporting of detailed HWE calculations should become mandatory for such studies in the future.},

We investigated consumption of adolescent red meat and other protein sources in relation to breast cancer risk in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. We followed prospectively 44,231 women aged 33-52 years who, in 1998, completed a detailed questionnaire about diet during adolescence. Relative risks (RR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%}CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression. We documented 1132 breast cancer cases during 13-year follow-up. In multivariable Cox regression models with major breast cancer risk factors adjustment, greater consumption of total red meat in adolescence was significantly associated with higher premenopausal breast cancer risk (highest vs. lowest quintiles, RR, 1.43; 95{\%}CI, 1.05-1.94; Ptrend = 0.007), but not postmenopausal breast cancer. Adolescent intake of poultry was associated with lower risk of breast cancer overall (RR, 0.76; 95{\%}CI, 0.60-0.97; for each serving/day). Adolescent intakes of iron, heme iron, fish, eggs, legumes and nuts were not associated with breast cancer. Replacement of one serving/day of total red meat with one serving of combination of poultry, fish, legumes, and nuts was associated with a 15{\%} lower risk of breast cancer overall (RR, 0.85; 95{\%}CI, 0.74-0.96) and a 23{\%} lower risk of premenopausal breast cancer (RR, 0.77; 95{\%}CI, 0.64-0.92). In conclusion, higher consumption of red meat during adolescence was associated with premenopausal breast cancer. Substituting other dietary protein sources for red meat in adolescent diet may decrease premenopausal breast cancer risk.},

abstract = {The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rapidly increasing in developing countries, especially among populations that are adopting Western-style diets. Several, but not all, epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that a high intake of meat, especially red and processed meat, is associated with increased CRC risk. Potential reasons for the association between high red and processed meat intake and CRC risk include the content of the meat (e.g. protein, heme) and compounds generated by the cooking process (e.g. N-nitroso compounds, heterocyclic amines). These factors can affect the large intestine mucosa with genotoxicity and metabolic disturbances. Increased bacterial fermentation (putrefaction) of undigested protein and production of bacterial metabolites derived from amino acids may affect colon epithelial homeostasis and renewal. This correlates with the fact that most colonic cancers are detected in the distal colon and rectum where protein fermentation actively occurs. However, there are still large controversies on the relationship between red meat consumption and CRC risk. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to enhance the current understanding on the association between high red and processed meat intakes with CRC risk. A principal focus of this review will be to discuss the meat-related components, such as proteins in the meat, heme, N-nitroso compounds, and heterocyclic amines, and the effects they have upon the large intestine mucosa and the intestinal gut microbiota. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Sulfotransferase (SULT) 1A1 is involved in the inactivation of estrogens and bioactivation of heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A G---{\textgreater}A transition at codon 213 (CGC/Arg to CAC/His) of the SULT1A1 gene was reported recently, and individuals homozygous for the His allele have a substantially lower activity of this enzyme than those with other genotypes. We hypothesized that the His allele may be a risk factor for breast cancer, particularly among women who had risk factors related to higher endogenous estrogen exposure. This hypothesis was investigated in a case-control study conducted in a cohort of postmenopausal Iowa women who completed a mailed questionnaire in 1986 on lifestyle factors including information on major breast cancer risk factors. DNA samples and information related to well-done meat intake were obtained from breast cancer cases diagnosed between 1992 and 1994 and a random sample of cancer-free cohort members. Multivariate analysis was performed on data from 156 cases and 332 controls who donated a blood sample. The frequency of the His allele was 41.6{\%} in cases and 34.1{\%} in controls (P = 0.03), and the risk of breast cancer was increased with the number of His alleles (P for trend = 0.02). Compared with women with the Arg/Arg genotype, an 80{\%} elevated risk was observed among women homozygous for the His allele (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.0-3.2; P = 0.04). This positive association was more pronounced among women who drank alcohol and had a high body mass index, early age at menarche, and late age at menopause, factors related to high endogenous estrogen exposure, than among those who did not have these risk factors. The risk of breast cancer was elevated with increasing doneness level of red meat intake among women with the Arg/Arg genotype (P for trend, 0.01) or the Arg/His genotype (P for trend, 0.10), whereas this association was not evident for women with the His/His genotype. The results from this study suggest that homozygosity for the SULT1A1 His213 allele may be a risk factor for breast cancer, and its effect may be modified by the exposure level of endogenous estrogens and heterocyclic amines.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dietary n-3 (omega-3) and n-6 (omega-6) PUFA have significant implications in health and disease prevention. Marine life is rich in long-chain n-3 PUFA. Children and adults in North America are reluctant fish eaters; canned tuna is a common fish in children's diets. Although a multitude of tuna products are available, their respective PUFA contents have not been well described. The aim of the present study was to compare the fatty acid (FA) profiles of different commercially available US tuna products.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Fat and FA composition of eight products randomly selected from two US suppliers were analysed with capillary GC after lipid extraction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: Large north-eastern US grocery store chain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUBJECTS: Canned tuna.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Energy from fat varied from 3 to 33 {\%} and the essential FA (EFA) linoleic acid (18 : 2n-6) and $\alpha$-linolenic acid (18 : 3n-3) varied tenfold. DHA varied between 90 and 770 mg/serving. The n-6:n-3 ratio was 3:1-4:1 in oil-packaged products, 2:1-7:1 in packaged tuna salads and 1:3-1:7 in water-packaged products. A similar magnitude of differences was seen in the ratio between arachidonic acid (20 : 4n-6) and DHA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Light tuna canned in water may be a better choice of providing n-3 PUFA to individuals in a healthy population, whereas oil-packaged products may be preferable for those individuals with a need for increased EFA, such as for patients with cystic fibrosis. Awareness regarding PUFA content may aid in consumer product choices and health-care provider advice.},

Mailed questionnaires were completed by 19 732 patients with histologically confirmed incident cancer of the stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, breast, ovary, prostate, testis, kidney, bladder, brain, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or leukaemia, and 5039 population controls,between 1994 and 1997. Measurement included information on socioeconomic status, lifestyle habits and diet. A 69-item food frequency questionnaire provided data on eating habits 2 years before the study. Odds ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals were derived through unconditional logistic regression. Compared with never adding salt at the table, always or often adding salt at the table was associated with an increased risk of stomach, lung, testicular and bladder cancer. Processed meat was significantly related to the risk of the stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, prostate, testis, kidney and bladder cancer and leukaemia; the odds ratios for the highest quartile ranged from 1.3 to 1.7. The findings add to the evidence that high consumption of salt and processed meat may play a role in the aetiology of several cancers.},

Inflammatory bowel disease is an important risk factor for the development of colon cancer. Inflammation is also likely to be involved with other forms of sporadic as well as heritable colon cancer. The molecular mechanisms by which inflammation promotes cancer development are still being uncovered and could differ between colitis-associated and other forms of colorectal cancer. Recent work has elucidated the role of distinct immune cells, cytokines, and other immune mediators in virtually all steps of colon tumorigenesis, including initiation, promotion, progression, and metastasis.

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a useful approach in the study of the genetic components of complex phenotypes. Aside from large cohorts, GWAS have generally been limited to the study of one or a few diseases or traits. The emergence of biobanks linked to electronic medical records (EMRs) allows the efficient reuse of genetic data to yield meaningful genotype-phenotype associations for multiple phenotypes or traits. Phase I of the electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE-I) Network is a National Human Genome Research Institute-supported consortium composed of five sites to perform various genetic association studies using DNA repositories and EMR systems. Each eMERGE site has developed EMR-based algorithms to comprise a core set of 14 phenotypes for extraction of study samples from each site's DNA repository. Each eMERGE site selected samples for a specific phenotype, and these samples were genotyped at either the Broad Institute or at the Center for Inherited Disease Research using the Illumina Infinium BeadChip technology. In all, approximately 17,000 samples from across the five sites were genotyped. A unified quality control (QC) pipeline was developed by the eMERGE Genomics Working Group and used to ensure thorough cleaning of the data. This process includes examination of sample and marker quality and various batch effects. Upon completion of the genotyping and QC analyses for each site's primary study, eMERGE Coordinating Center merged the datasets from all five sites. This larger merged dataset reentered the established eMERGE QC pipeline. Based on lessons learned during the process, additional analyses and QC checkpoints were added to the pipeline to ensure proper merging. Here, we explore the challenges associated with combining datasets from different genotyping centers and describe the expansion to eMERGE QC pipeline for merged datasets. These additional steps will be useful as the eMERGE project expands to include additional sites in eMERGE-II, and also serve as a starting point for investigators merging multiple genotype datasets accessible through the National Center for Biotechnology Information in the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes. Our experience demonstrates that merging multiple datasets after additional QC can be an efficient use of genotype data despite new challenges that appear in the process.},

Birthplace, which serves as an indicator of migrant status, can be used to further identify subpopulations to be targeted for disease control and to provide more specific information on disease patterns. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries obtain data on race, Hispanic ethnicity, and birthplace primarily from hospital records. Because there are previously documented problems with the completeness and accuracy of these data in the registry, there was an interest in assessing the policies and practices at the hospital level in the collection of patient data on race, ethnicity, and birthplace. The results indicate that inconsistent hospital policies and practices contribute to the lack of completeness and accuracy of data on race, ethnicity, and birthplace in cancer registries.},

abstract = {Background: Cancer is the leading cause of death among Hispanics. The burden of cancer mortality within Hispanic groups has not been well quantified.Methods: Cancer mortality rates for 2008-2012 in Florida were computed on the basis of race, ethnicity, and birthplace, specifically focusing on major Hispanic groups-Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Central Americans, South Americans, and Dominicans. Age-adjusted mortality rate ratios derived from negative binomial regression were used to compare Hispanics, aggregated and by group, to nonHispanic whites (NHW).Results: A total of 205,369 cancer deaths from 2008-2012 were analyzed, of which 22,042 occurred in Hispanics. Overall cancer mortality rates were lower for Hispanics, 159 and 100 per 100,000 in males and females, respectively, compared with 204 and 145 per 100,000 in NHWs, largely driven by relatively low rates of lung and breast cancers among Hispanics. However, Hispanics had a higher risk of death from stomach and liver cancers, both infection-related. Of all Hispanic groups, Mexicans had the lowest mortality, whereas Cubans had the highest, with significantly higher mortality for colorectal, endometrial, and prostate cancers.Conclusions: Compared with other Hispanic groups, Cubans and Puerto Ricans had significantly higher rates. For these longer-established populations in the United States, increases in diet and obesity-related cancers are evident. Some groups show excesses that clearly fall out of the common Hispanic patterns, with implications for public health: Cubans for colorectal cancer, Puerto Ricans for liver cancer, and Dominicans for prostate cancer.Impact: Cancer mortality outcomes in Hispanics vary between ethnic groups.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We modelled the efficiency of a personalised approach to screening for prostate and breast cancer based on age and polygenic risk-profile compared with the standard approach based on age alone. METHODS: We compared the number of cases potentially detectable by screening in a population undergoing personalised screening with a population undergoing screening based on age alone. Polygenic disease risk was assumed to have a log-normal relative risk distribution predicted for the currently known prostate or breast cancer susceptibility variants (N=31 and N=18, respectively). RESULTS: Compared with screening men based on age alone (aged 55-79: 10-year absolute risk {\textgreater}/=2{\%}), personalised screening of men age 45-79 at the same risk threshold would result in 16{\%} fewer men being eligible for screening at a cost of 3{\%} fewer screen-detectable cases, but with added benefit of detecting additional cases in younger men at high risk. Similarly, compared with screening women based on age alone (aged 47-79: 10-year absolute risk {\textgreater}/=2.5{\%}), personalised screening of women age 35-79 at the same risk threshold would result in 24{\%} fewer women being eligible for screening at a cost of 14{\%} fewer screen-detectable cases. CONCLUSION: Personalised screening approach could improve the efficiency of screening programmes. This has potential implications on informing public health policy on cancer screening.},

Deregulation of biological processes such as oxidative stress, angiogenesis, and autophagy elicit favorable immune response towards chronic inflammation. Apart from the role in carcinogenesis, chronic inflammation also favors the emergence of drug resistance clones by inducing the growth of breast cancer stem-like cells. Immunomodulation mediated by cytokines, chemokines and several other growth factors present in the tumor microenvironment regulate chronic inflammatory response and alter crosstalk among various signaling pathways such as NF-$\kappa$B, Nrf-2, JAK-STAT, Akt and MAPKs involved in the progression of breast cancer.

This paper presents the amino acid composition, amino acid score and in vitro protein digestibility of fifteen foods that are commonly consumed in Northwest Mexico. The foods were prepared by the traditional methods and were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. The chemical score for each food was determined using the recommendations for children of 1-2 years of age, and the digestibility was evaluated using a multienzyme technique. Lysine was the limiting amino acid in cereal-based products (scores 15 to 54), and methionine and cysteine were limiting in legume products (scores 41 to 47), boiled beef (score = 75) and hamburger (score = 82). The method of preparation had an effect on the content of certain amino acids, some of them increased and others decreased their content. Meat products and regional cheese provided a high amino acid score (scores 67 to 91) and digestibility (80.7 to 87.8{\%}). Bologna, a processed meat product, had a lower digestibility (75.4{\%}). Data on the amino acid composition of foods commonly consumed in Mexico can be used to provide valuable information on food analysis and protein quality, and to contribute to nutrition and health research and health programs.

abstract = {Objective: Microsatellite instability (MSI) is one form of genomic instability that occurs in 10{\%} to 20{\%} of sporadic colon tumors and almost all hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancers. However, little is known about how environmental factors (e.g., diet) may influence MSI in sporadic colon cancer. Methods: We used data from a population-based case-control study in North Carolina (486 colon cancer cases and 1,048 controls) to examine associations of diet (total energy, macronutrients, micronutrients, and food groups) with MSI. In-person interviews elicited information on potential colon cancer risk factors, and a previously validated food frequency questionnaire adapted to include regional foods was used to assess diet over the year before diagnosis or interview date. MSI was classified as MSI-high (MSI-H) and MSI-low or microsatellite stable (MSI-L/MSS). Multivariate logistic regression models estimated energy-adjusted and non-energy-adjusted odds ratios (OR). Results: Ten percent of the cases (n = 49) had MSI-H tumors (29{\%} African American). The strongest associations between diet and MSI were observed in case-control comparisons: there was a robust inverse association between MSI-H status and beta-carotene [OR, 0.4; 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI), 0.2-0.9] and positive associations with energy-adjusted refined carbohydrates (OR, 2.2; 95{\%} CI, 0.9-5.4) and non-energy-adjusted read meat intake (OR, 2.0; 95{\%} CI, 0.9-4.2). Compared with controls, MSI-L/MSS tumors were statistically significantly associated with energy-adjusted vitamin C, vitamin E, calcium, dietary fiber, and dark green vegetables and positively associated with total energy intake (all Ps for trend {\textless} 0.05). In case-case comparisons, no dietary factors were significantly differently related to MSI-H compared with MSI-L/MSS tumors. Conclusion: Refined carbohydrate and red meat consumption may promote development of MSI-H tumors, whereas beta-carotene may be associated with lower risk.},

abstract = {Recent identifications of associations between novel variants in inflammation-related genes and several common diseases emphasize the need for systematic evaluations of these genes in disease susceptibility. Considering that many genes are involved in the complex inflammation responses and many genetic variants in these genes have the potential to alter the functions and expression of these genes, we assembled a list of key inflammation-related genes to facilitate the identification of genetic associations of diseases with an inflammation-related etiology. We first reviewed various phases of inflammation responses, including the development of immune cells, sensing of danger, influx of cells to sites of insult, activation and functional responses of immune and non-immune cells, and resolution of the immune response. Assisted by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we then identified 17 functional sub-pathways that are involved in one or multiple phases. This organization would greatly increase the chance of detecting gene-gene interactions by hierarchical clustering of genes with their functional closeness in a pathway. Finally, as an example application, we have developed tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (tSNP) arrays for populations of European and African descent to capture all the common variants of these key inflammation-related genes. Assays of these tSNPs have been designed and assembled into two Affymetrix ParAllele customized chips, one each for European (12,011 SNPs) and African (21,542 SNPs) populations. These tSNPs have greater coverage for these inflammation-related genes compared to the existing genome-wide arrays, particularly in the African population. These tSNP arrays can facilitate systematic evaluation of inflammation pathways in disease susceptibility. For additional applications, other genotyping platforms could also be employed. For existing genome-wide association data, this list of key inflammation-related genes and associated subpathways can facilitate comprehensive inflammation pathway- focused association analyses.},

abstract = {The TGF-$\beta$ signaling pathway regulates cellular proliferation and differentiation. We evaluated genetic variation in this pathway, its association with breast cancer survival, and survival differences by genetic ancestry and self-reported ethnicity. The Breast Cancer Health Disparities Study includes participants from the 4-Corners Breast Cancer Study (n = 1,391 cases) and the San Francisco Bay Area Breast Cancer Study (n = 946 cases) who have been followed for survival. We evaluated 28 genes in the TGF-$\beta$ signaling pathway using a tagSNP approach. Adaptive rank truncated product (ARTP) was used to test the gene and pathway significance by Native American (NA) ancestry and by self-reported ethnicity (non-Hispanic white (NHW) and Hispanic/NA). Genetic variation in the TGF-$\beta$ signaling pathway was associated with overall breast cancer survival (P ARTP = 0.05), especially for women with low NA ancestry (P ARTP = 0.007) and NHW women (P ARTP = 0.006). BMP2, BMP4, RUNX1, and TGFBR3 were significantly associated with breast cancer survival overall (P ARTP = 0.04, 0.02, 0.002, and 0.04, respectively). Among women with low NA, ancestry associations were as follows: BMP4 (P ARTP = 0.007), BMP6 (P ARTP = 0.001), GDF10 (P ARTP = 0.05), RUNX1 (P ARTP = 0.002), SMAD1 (P ARTP = 0.05), and TGFBR2 (P ARTP = 0.02). A polygenic risk model showed that women with low NA ancestry and high numbers of at-risk alleles had twice the risk of dying from breast cancer as did women with high NA ancestry. Our data suggest that genetic variation in the TGF-$\beta$ signaling pathway influences breast cancer survival. Associations were similar when the analyses were stratified by genetic ancestry or by self-reported ethnicity.},

abstract = {Cancer has been characterized as a heterogeneous disease consisting of many different subtypes. The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes.},

abstract = {Studies have examined nutrient differences among people following different plant-based diets. However, all of these studies have been observational. The aim of the present study was to examine differences in nutrient intake and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) scores among overweight and obese (body mass index 25.0-49.9 kg/m2) adults randomized to receive dietary instruction on a vegan (n = 12), vegetarian (n = 13), pescovegetarian (n = 13), semivegetarian (n = 13), or omnivorous (n = 12) diet during a 6-month randomized controlled trial. Nutrient intake, nutrient adequacy, and DII score were assessed via two 24-hour dietary recalls (Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Recall) at baseline and at 2 and 6 months. Differences in nutrient intake and the DII were examined using general linear models with follow-up tests at each time point. We hypothesized that individuals randomized to the vegan diet would have lower DII scores and greater improvements in fiber, carbohydrate, fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol at both 2 and 6 months as compared with the other 4 diets. Participants randomized to the vegan diet had significantly greater changes in most macronutrients at both time points, including fat and saturated fat, as well as cholesterol and, at 2 months, fiber, as compared with most of the other diet groups (Ps {\textless}05). Vegan, vegetarian, and pescovegetarian participants all saw significant improvements in the DII score as compared with semivegetarian participants at 2 months (Ps {\textless}05) with no differences at 6 months. Given the greater impact on macronutrients and the DII during the short term, finding ways to provide support for adoption and maintenance of plant-based dietary approaches, such as vegan and vegetarian diets, should be given consideration.},

abstract = {Research has been mixed on the potential risks and resources that ethnic enclaves may confer upon residents: whereas some authors characterize racial and ethnic minority neighborhoods through the lens of segregation and risk, others argue that these minority neighborhoods are ethnic enclaves that can improve the availability of resources to residents. In this study, we sought to assess two predominantly Latino New York City neighborhoods (one enclave neighborhood and one comparison) in the areas of structural resources (e.g., grocers, parks), cultural resources (e.g., botanicas, hair salons), and risks (e.g., empty lots, bars) by street-level coding in 20 census tracts (streets N = 202). We used Poisson generalized linear models to assess whether enclave status of a neighborhood predicted the numbers of risks and resources on streets within those neighborhoods. Enclave status did not predict the number of risks (Rate ratio = 1.08(0.83, 1.42), $\chi$ (2)(1, N = 202) = 0.35, p = n. s.) or cultural resources (Rate ratio = 0.87(0.54, 1.40), $\chi$ (2)(1, N = 202) = 0.34, p = n. s.), yet it was associated with a higher number of structural resources (Rate ratio = 1.90(1.48, 2.43), $\chi$ (2)(1, N = 202) = 25.74, p {\textless} 0.001). The results suggest that while living in an ethnic enclave may not reduce risks, it may help residents cope with those risks through an increased number of structural resources. These findings support theories that conceptualize ethnic enclaves as neighborhoods where greater resources are available to residents. The focus on resources within this work was instrumental, as no difference would have been found if a solely risk-focused approach had been employed.},

abstract = {The incidence of breast cancer is 35{\%} lower in Hispanic women living in the San Francisco Bay Area than in non-Hispanic White women. We have previously described a significant association between genetic ancestry and risk for breast cancer in a sample of U.S. Hispanics/Latinas. We retested the association in women residing in Mexico because of the possibility that the original finding may be confounded by U.S. specific unmeasured environmental exposures. We genotyped a set of 106 ancestry informative markers in 846 Mexican women with breast cancer and 1,035 unaffected controls and estimated genetic ancestry using a maximum likelihood method. Odds ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI) for ancestry modeled as a categorical and continuous variable were estimated using logistic regression and adjusted for reproductive and other known risk factors. Greater European ancestry was associated with increased breast cancer risk in this new and independent sample of Mexican women residing in Mexico. Compared with women with 0{\%} to 25{\%} European ancestry, the risk was increased for women with 51{\%} to 75{\%} and 76{\%} to 100{\%} European ancestry [odds ratios, 1.35 (95{\%} CI, 0.96-1.91) and 2.44 (95{\%} CI, 0.94-6.35), respectively; P for trend = 0.044]. For every 25{\%} increase in European ancestry (modeled as a continuous variable), there was a 20{\%} increase in risk for breast cancer (95{\%} CI, 1.03-1.41; P = 0.019). These results suggest that nongenetic factors play a crucial role in explaining the difference in breast cancer incidence between Latinas and non-Latina White women, and it also points out to the possibility of a genetic component to this difference.},

We used relevant keywords and searched online international electronic databases, including PubMed and NLM Gateway (for Medline), Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), and Scopus for articles published through February 2017. All cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies were included in this meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effects meta-analysis method to address heterogeneity among studies. Findings were analyzed statistically. Nine studies were included in the present systematic review and meta-analysis. The total sample size of these studies was 296,102, and the number of participants varied from 1453 to 122,788. The random effects meta-analysis showed a positive and significant association between DIP and the risk of breast cancer (pooled odds ratio, 1.14; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.01-1.27). The pooled effect size was not statistically significant because of the type of studies, including cohort (pooled relative risk, 1.04; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.98-1.10) and case-control (pooled odds ratio, 1.63; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.89-2.37) studies.

abstract = {Opposing effects of inflammation on cancer have been described. Acute inflammation usually counteracts cancer development, while chronic inflammation promotes cancer development. Just as inactivation of the p53 pathway may be universal in the neoplasia, the activation of the NF$\kappa$B pathway may, conversely, be frequent in carcinogenesis, and a requirement for inflammation and promotion. TNF, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine when binding to TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), may cause survival or apoptosis, dependent on biochemical modifications that determine the type of complex formed; one complex causes NF$\kappa$B activation and gives a cell survival signal (pro-oncogenic), while the other (modified) complex recruits caspases and causes apoptosis (anti-oncogenic). Fas-ligand (FasL)-Fas interaction can also result in opposing effects on carcinogenesis due to similar mechanisms. While IL-6 counteracts apoptosis and can promote cancer development, interferons can increase DNA repair and stabilize p53, thereby be anti-oncogenic. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to examine discrepancies in alcohol consumption estimates between a self-reported standard quantity-frequency measure and an adjusted version based on respondents' typically used container size. METHOD: Using a multistage cluster sample design, 5,224 Hispanic individuals 18 years of age and older were selected from the household population in five metropolitan areas of the United States: Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Houston, and Los Angeles. The survey-weighted response rate was 76{\%}. Personal interviews lasting an average of 1 hour were conducted in respondents' homes in either English or Spanish. RESULTS: The overall effect of container adjustment was to increase estimates of ethanol consumption by 68{\%} for women (range across Hispanic groups: 17{\%}-99{\%}) and 30{\%} for men (range: 14{\%}-42{\%}). With the exception of female Cuban American, Mexican American, and South/Central American beer drinkers and male Cuban American wine drinkers, all percentage differences between unadjusted and container-adjusted estimates were positive. Second, container adjustments produced the largest change for volume of distilled spirits, followed by wine and beer. Container size adjustments generally produced larger percentage increases in consumption estimates for the higher volume drinkers, especially the upper tertile of female drinkers. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported alcohol consumption based on standard drinks underreports consumption when compared with reports based on the amount of alcohol poured into commonly used containers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Cause-specific (CS) and net survival in a relative survival framework (RS) are two of the most common methods for estimating cancer survival. In this paper, we assess the differences in results produced by two permutations of cause-specific and relative survival applied to estimating cancer survival and disparities in cancer survival, using data from First Nations and non-Aboriginal populations in Canada. METHODS Subjects were members of the 1991 Canadian Census Mortality Cohort, a population-based cohort of adult respondents to the 1991 Long Form Census who have been followed up for incident cancers and death through linkage to administrative databases. We compared four methods: relative survival analyses with ethnicity-specific life tables (RS-ELT); relative survival with general population life tables (RS-GLT); cause-specific survival with a broad definition of cancer death (CS-Broad); and cause-specific survival with a narrow definition of cause of death (CS-Narrow) and applied these to the nine most common cancers among First Nations. RESULTS Apart from breast and prostate cancers, RS-ELT, RS-GLT, and CS-Broad tended to produce similar estimates of age-standardized five-year survival, whereas CS-Narrow yielded higher estimates of survival. CS-Narrow estimates were particularly unlike those based on the other methods for cancers of the digestive and respiratory tracts. Estimates of disparities in survival were generally comparable across the four methods except for breast and prostate cancers. CONCLUSIONS Cancer surveillance efforts in sub-populations defined by race, ethnicity, geography, socioeconomic status, or similar factors are necessary for identifying disparities and monitoring progress toward reducing them. In the absence of routine monitoring of cancer survival and cancer survival disparities in these populations, estimates generated by different methods will inevitably be compared over time and across populations. In this study, we demonstrate that caution should be exercised in making these comparisons, particularly in interpreting cause-specific survival rates with an unknown or narrow definition of cancer death and in estimates of breast and prostate cancer survival and/or disparities in survival generated by different methods.},

abstract = {It is well established that an increase of n-6 polyunsaturated (i.e. arachidonic and arachidonic-converted linoleic acids) fat dietary intake enhances carcinogenesis and promotes tumorigenesis through oxidative metabolism. The Cyclooxygenase (COX) and Lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes mediate the oxidative metabolism of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and generate a cascade of biological active molecules. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) modulating arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism have been utilized in cancer chemoprevention. The gastrolesivity of a prolonged use of nonselective NSAIDs, due to the COX inhibition, an important housekeeping gene of the gastrointestinal system, contraindicated their use in chemoprevention. Moreover, cardiovascular side effects emerged in the long-term use of COX-2 specific inhibitors rising doubts on their use for cancer chemoprevention. This evidence renewed the interest into other AA-metabolizing pathways relevant in inflammation and carcinogenesis. Here, the role of the LOXs pathways in carcinogenesis is reviewed. Inhibition of the LOX pathways, alone or in association with COX-2 pathway, appears to be a promising field for detecting new molecular target and engineering new chemopreventive strategies on cancer.},

abstract = {High dietary intake of calcium has been classified as a probable cause of prostate cancer, although the mechanism underlying the association between dietary calcium and prostate cancer risk is unclear. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a key regulator of calcium absorption. In the small intestine, VDR expression is regulated by the CDX-2 transcription factor, which binds a polymorphic site in the VDR gene promoter. We examined VDR Cdx2 genotype and calcium intake, assessed by a food frequency questionnaire, in 533 African-American prostate cancer cases (256 with advanced stage at diagnosis, 277 with localized stage) and 250 African-American controls who participated in the California Collaborative Prostate Cancer Study. We examined the effects of genotype, calcium intake, and diet-gene interactions by conditional logistic regression. Compared with men in the lowest quartile of calcium intake, men in the highest quartile had an approximately twofold increased risk of localized and advanced prostate cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 2.20, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.40, 3.46), with a significant dose-response. Poor absorbers of calcium (VDR Cdx2 GG genotype) had a significantly lower risk of advanced prostate cancer (OR = 0.41, 95{\%} CI = 0.19, 0.90). The gene-calcium interaction was statistically significant (p = 0.03). Among men with calcium intake below the median (680 mg/day), carriers of the G allele had an approximately 50{\%} decreased risk compared with men with the AA genotype. These findings suggest a link between prostate cancer risk and high intestinal absorption of calcium.},

abstract = {The effects of diet on breast cancer are controversial and whether the effects vary with hormone receptor status has not been well investigated. This study evaluated the associations of dietary factors with risk for breast cancer overall and by the hormone receptor status of tumors among Chinese women. The Shanghai Breast Cancer Study, a large, population-based, case-control study, enrolled 3,443 cases and 3,474 controls in 1996-1998 (phase I) and 2002-2005 (phase II); 2676 cases had estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) data. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated, quantitative, food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI) were derived from multivariate, polychotomous, unconditional logistic regression models. Total vegetable intake was inversely related to breast cancer risk, with an adjusted OR for the highest quintile of 0.80 (95{\%} CI = 0.67-0.95; P trend = 0.02). Reduced risk was also related to high intake of allium vegetables (P trend = 0.01) and fresh legumes (P trend = 0.0008). High intake of citrus fruits and rosaceae fruits were inversely associated with breast cancer risk (P trend = 0.003 and 0.004, respectively), although no consistent association was seen for total fruit intake. Elevated risk was observed for all types of meat and fish intake (all P trend {\textless} 0.05), whereas intakes of eggs and milk were associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer (both P trend {\textless}0.05). There was little evidence that associations with dietary intakes varied across the 4 tumor subtypes or between ER+/PR+ and ER-/PR- tumors (P for heterogeneity {\textgreater}0.05). Our results suggest that high intake of total vegetables, certain fruits, milk, and eggs may reduce the risk of breast cancer, whereas high consumption of animal-source foods may increase risk. The dietary associations did not appear to vary by ER/PR status.},

abstract = {Tobacco smoking is a bladder cancer risk factor and a source of carcinogens that induce DNA damage to urothelial cells. Using data and samples from 988 cases and 1,004 controls enrolled in the Los Angeles County Bladder Cancer Study and the Shanghai Bladder Cancer Study, we investigated associations between bladder cancer risk and 632 tagSNPs that comprehensively capture genetic variation in 28 DNA repair genes from four DNA repair pathways: base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination repair (HHR). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for each tagSNP were corrected for multiple testing for all SNPs within each gene using pACT and for genes within each pathway and across pathways with Bonferroni. Gene and pathway summary estimates were obtained using ARTP. We observed an association between bladder cancer and POLB rs7832529 (BER) (pACT = 0.003; ppathway = 0.021) among all, and SNPs in XPC (NER) and OGG1 (BER) among Chinese men and women, respectively. The NER pathway showed an overall association with risk among Chinese males (ARTP NER p = 0.034). The XRCC6 SNP rs2284082 (NHEJ), also in LD with SREBF2, showed an interaction with smoking (smoking status interaction pgene = 0.001, ppathway = 0.008, poverall = 0.034). Our findings support a role in bladder carcinogenesis for regions that map close to or within BER (POLB, OGG1) and NER genes (XPC). A SNP that tags both the XRCC6 and SREBF2 genes strongly modifies the association between bladder cancer risk and smoking.},

abstract = {Background: Breast cancer incidence is lower in many U.S. ethnic minority and foreign-born population groups. Investigating whether migration and acculturation patterns in risk are reflected in disease biomarkers may help to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.Methods: We compared the distribution of breast cancer risk factors across U.S.-born white, African American and Hispanic women, and foreign-born Hispanic women (n = 477, ages 40-64 years, 287 born in Caribbean countries). We used linear regression models to examine the associations of migration history and linguistic acculturation with mammographic breast density (MBD), measured using computer-assisted methods as percent and area of dense breast tissue.Results: The distribution of most breast cancer risk factors varied by ethnicity, nativity, and age at migration. In age- and body mass index-adjusted models, U.S.-born women did not differ in average MBD according to ethnicity, but foreign-born Hispanic women had lower MBD [e.g., -4.50{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), -7.12 to -1.89 lower percent density in foreign- vs. U.S.-born Hispanic women]. Lower linguistic acculturation and lower percent of life spent in the United States were also associated with lower MBD [e.g., monolingual Spanish and bilingual vs. monolingual English speakers, respectively, had 5.09{\%} (95{\%} CI, -8.33 to -1.85) and 3.34{\%} (95{\%} CI, -6.57 to -0.12) lower percent density]. Adjusting for risk factors (e.g., childhood body size, parity) attenuated some of these associations.Conclusions: Hispanic women predominantly born in Caribbean countries have lower MBD than U.S.-born women of diverse ethnic backgrounds, including U.S.-born Hispanic women of Caribbean heritage.Impact: MBD may provide insight into mechanisms driving geographic and migration variations in breast cancer risk.

abstract = {Imputation is an extremely valuable tool in conducting and synthesising genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Directly typed SNP quality control (QC) is thought to affect imputation quality. It is, therefore, common practise to use quality-controlled (QCed) data as an input for imputing genotypes. This study aims to determine the effect of commonly applied QC steps on imputation outcomes. We performed several iterations of imputing SNPs across chromosome 22 in a dataset consisting of 3177 samples with Illumina 610 k (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) GWAS data, applying different QC steps each time. The imputed genotypes were compared with the directly typed genotypes. In addition, we investigated the correlation between alternatively QCed data. We also applied a series of post-imputation QC steps balancing elimination of poorly imputed SNPs and information loss. We found that the difference between the unQCed data and the fully QCed data on imputation outcome was minimal. Our study shows that imputation of common variants is generally very accurate and robust to GWAS QC, which is not a major factor affecting imputation outcome. A minority of common-frequency SNPs with particular properties cannot be accurately imputed regardless of QC stringency. These findings may not generalise to the imputation of low frequency and rare variants.},

abstract = {The cooked meat derived genotoxic carcinogen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) induces cancer of the colon, prostate and mammary gland when fed to rats. Epidemiology studies link these tumours to a Western diet and exposure to heterocyclic amines such as PhIP. We have shown that PhIP is also potently estrogenic and have proposed that this hormonal activity contributes to its target site carcinogenicity. We now postulate that the estrogenic properties of PhIP influence metastatic potential. We have used an in vitro assay for cell invasion based upon digestion and migration through a reconstituted basement membrane model. Zymography and immunoblotting were used to confirm PhIP-mediated changes associated with induction of the invasive phenotype. Treatment of the mammary cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47D with PhIP induces cells to digest and migrate through a reconstituted basement membrane. The response was dose dependent, observed at sub-nanomolar concentrations of PhIP and was inhibited by the antiestrogen ICI 182,780. The PhIP-induced invasive phenotype was associated with expression of cathepsin D, cyclooxygenase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase activity. These findings emphasise the range and potency of the biological activities associated with this cooked meat product and mechanistically support the tissue-specific carcinogenicity of the chemical. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have assessed the association of body size with postmenopausal breast cancer risk in Hispanic women. Findings are inconsistent and appear to contradict those reported for non-Hispanic white (NHW) women. METHODS: We pooled interview and anthropometric data for 2,023 Hispanic and 2,384 NHW women from two U.S. population-based case-control studies. Using logistic regression analysis, we examined associations of overall and abdominal adiposity with risk of postmenopausal breast cancer defined by estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status. RESULTS: Weight gain was associated with increased risk of ER(+)PR(+) breast cancer in Hispanics not currently using menopausal hormone therapy (HT), but only among those with a low young-adult body mass index (BMI). In the subset of Hispanics with data on genetic ancestry, the association with weight gain was limited to women with lower Indigenous American ancestry. Young-adult BMI was inversely associated with both ER(+)PR(+) and ER(-)PR(-) breast cancers for both ethnicities combined, with similar, although nonsignificant, inverse trends in Hispanics and NHWs. Among all Hispanics, regardless of HT use, height was associated with risk of ER(-)PR(-) breast cancer and hip circumference with risk of breast cancer overall. CONCLUSIONS: Body size throughout adult life is associated with breast cancer risk among postmenopausal Hispanic women, as has been reported for NHW women. Associations were specific for breast cancer subtypes defined by hormone receptor status. IMPACT: Avoiding weight gain and maintaining a healthy weight are important strategies to reduce the risk of postmenopausal ER(+)PR(+) breast cancer, the most common breast cancer subtype.Copyright {\textcopyright}2014 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We have conducted a quantitative analysis of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) and -beta (ER-beta) mRNA expression in normal thyroid and tumor tissues. METHODS: Normal thyroid tissues (n = 10) and tumor tissues [(follicular adenoma (n = 14), follicular carcinoma (n = 8), papillary carcinoma (n = 14), anaplastic carcinoma (n = 3) and medullary carcinoma (n = 6)] were obtained at surgery from 45 female patients. ER-alpha and ER-beta mRNA expression has been studied by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: ER-alpha mRNA levels in the normal thyroid were not significantly different from those in follicular adenomas, papillary carcinomas and medullary carcinomas but were marginally (p = 0.08) higher than those in follicular and anaplastic carcinomas. ER-beta mRNA levels in the normal thyroid tissues were not significantly different from those in any other tumor tissues. ER-beta to ER-alpha mRNA ratios were significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) higher in the normal thyroid tissues than in follicular adenomas. Proportions of ER-beta mRNA variants (ER-beta 1, 2, 5, and 5') did not significantly differ among the normal and tumor tissues. CONCLUSIONS: A downregulation of ER-alpha mRNA in follicular and anaplastic carcinomas seems to suggest that estrogens are unlikely to play an important role in the carcinogenesis and progression of these carcinomas. On the other hand, a significant decrease in ER-beta to ER-alpha mRNA ratios in follicular adenomas suggests a possible involvement of estrogens in the pathogenesis of this disease since the same phenomenon has been reported on estrogen-dependent breast cancers.},

abstract = {The relationship between meat consumption and breast cancer has been the focus of several epidemiological investigations, yet there has been no clear scientific consensus as to whether red or processed meat intake increases the risk of breast cancer. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis incorporating data from several recently published prospective studies of red or processed meat intake and breast cancer. In the meta-analysis utilising data from the Pooling Project publication (includes data from eight cohorts) combined with data from nine studies published between 2004 and 2009 and one study published in 1996, the fixed-effect summary relative risk estimate (SRRE) for red meat intake (high v. low) and breast cancer was 1{\textperiodcentered}02 (95 {\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}98, 1{\textperiodcentered}07; P value for heterogeneity = 0{\textperiodcentered}001) and the random-effects SRRE was 1{\textperiodcentered}07 (95 {\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}98, 1{\textperiodcentered}17). The SRRE for each 100 g increment of red meat was 1{\textperiodcentered}04 (95 {\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}00, 1{\textperiodcentered}07), based on a fixed-effects model, and 1{\textperiodcentered}12 (95 {\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}03, 1{\textperiodcentered}23) based on a random-effects model. No association was observed for each 100 g increment of red meat among premenopausal women (SRRE 1{\textperiodcentered}01; 95 {\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}92, 1{\textperiodcentered}11) but a statistically significant SRRE of 1{\textperiodcentered}22 (95 {\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}04, 1{\textperiodcentered}44) was observed among postmenopausal women using a random-effects model. However, the association for postmenopausal women was attenuated and non-significant when using a fixed-effects model (SRRE 1{\textperiodcentered}03; 95 {\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}98, 1{\textperiodcentered}08). The fixed- and random-effect SRRE for high (v. low) processed meat intake and breast cancer were 1{\textperiodcentered}00 (95 {\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}98, 1{\textperiodcentered}01; P value for heterogeneity = 0{\textperiodcentered}005) and 1{\textperiodcentered}08 (95 {\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}01, 1{\textperiodcentered}16), respectively. The fixed- and random-effect SRRE for each 30 g increment of processed meat were 1{\textperiodcentered}03 (95 {\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}00, 1{\textperiodcentered}06) and 1{\textperiodcentered}06 (95 {\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}99, 1{\textperiodcentered}14), respectively. Overall, weak positive summary associations were observed across all meta-analysis models, with the majority being non-statistically significant. Heterogeneity was evident in most analyses, summary associations were sensitive to the choice of analytical model (fixed v. random effects), and publication bias appeared to have produced slightly elevated summary associations. On the basis of this quantitative assessment, red meat and processed meat intake does not appear to be independently associated with increasing the risk of breast cancer, although further investigations of potential effect modifiers, such as analyses by hormone receptor status, may provide valuable insight to potential patterns of associations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate of all gynecologic malignancies, and most women present with advanced-stage disease. The current investigation was performed to determine the efficacy of annual transvaginal sonography (TVS) as a screening method for ovarian cancer.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Annual TVS screening was performed on 25,327 women from 1987 to 2005. Asymptomatic women aged{\textgreater}or=50 years and women aged{\textgreater}or=25 years who had a family history of ovarian cancer were eligible for participation in this trial.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Among 364 patients (1.4{\%}) with a persisting ovarian tumor on TVS who underwent exploratory laparoscopy or laparotomy with tumor removal, 35 primary invasive ovarian cancers, 9 serous ovarian tumors of low malignant potential, and 7 cancers metastatic to the ovary were detected. Stage distribution was as follows: 28 patients had stage I disease, 8 patients had stage II disease, and 8 patients had stage III disease. Four patients died of disease, 2 patients died of other causes, and 38 patients were alive and well from 0.5 years to 15.8 years after diagnosis (mean, 5.3 years). Nine women developed ovarian cancer within 12 months of a negative screen (false-negative results), and 3 of these patients died of disease. TVS screening had a sensitivity of 85.0{\%}, specificity of 98.7{\%}, positive predictive value of 14.01{\%}, and negative predictive value of 99.9{\%}. After 107,276 screening years, there have been 7 ovarian cancer deaths in the annually screened population and 3 ovarian cancer deaths among women who were noncompliant. Excluding patients with nonepithelial or borderline ovarian malignancies, the survival of patients with ovarian cancer in the annually screened population was 89.9{\%}+/-10.1{\%} at 2 years and 77.2{\%}+/-22.8{\%} at 5 years.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: TVS screening, when it was performed annually, was associated with a decrease in disease stage at detection and with case-specific ovarian cancer mortality, but it was not effective in detecting ovarian cancers in women who had normal ovarian volume.},

abstract = {Despite the considerable enthusiasm about the yield of novel and replicated discoveries of genetic associations from the new generation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the proportion of the heritability of most complex diseases that have been studied to date remains small. Some of this "dark matter" could be due to gene-environment (G x E) interactions or more complex pathways involving multiple genes and exposures. We review the basic epidemiologic study design and statistical analysis approaches to studying G x E interactions individually and then consider more comprehensive approaches to studying entire pathways or GWAS data. In addition to the usual issues in genetic association studies, particular care is needed in exposure assessment, and very large sample sizes are required. Although hypothesis-driven, pathway-based and agnostic GWA study approaches are generally viewed as opposite poles, we suggest that the two can be usefully married using hierarchical modeling strategies that exploit external pathway knowledge in mining genome-wide data.},

abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic aromatic compounds (HACs) constitute a major class of chemical carcinogens present in the environment. These compounds require activation to electrophilic metabolites to exert their mutagenic or carcinogenic effects. There are three principal pathways currently proposed for metabolic activation of PAH and HAC: the pathway via bay region dihydrodiol epoxide by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), the pathway via radical cation by one-electron oxidation, and the ortho-quinone pathway by dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DD). In addition to these major pathways, a brief description of a minor metabolic activation pathway, sulfonation, for PAHs that contain a primary benzylic alcoholic group or secondary hydroxyl group(s) is included in this review. The DNA damages caused through the reactive metabolites of PAH/HAC are described involving the DNA covalent binding to form stable or depurinating adducts, the formation of apurinic sites, and the oxidative damage. The review emphasizes the chemical/biochemical reactions involved in the metabolic processes and the chemical structures of metabolites and DNA adducts. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd Background: The severity of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is a fundamental feature of asthma. The severity of BHR varies between asthmatics and is associated with lack of asthma control. The mechanisms underlying this trait are still unclear. This study aimed to identify genes associated with BHR severity, using a genomewide association study (GWAS) on the slope of BHR in adult asthmatics. Methods: We performed a GWAS on BHR severity in adult asthmatics from the Dutch Asthma GWAS cohort (n = 650), adjusting for smoking and inhaled corticosteroid use, and verified results in three other cohorts. Furthermore, we performed eQTL and co-expression analyses in lung tissue. Results: In the discovery cohort, one genomewide significant hit located in phosphodiesterase 4D, cAMP-specif (PDE4D) and 26 SNPs with P-values  {\textless}  1*10 −5 were found. None of our findings replicated in adult and childhood replication cohorts jointly. In adult cohorts separately, rs1344110 in pituitary tumour-transforming 1 interacting protein (PTTG1IP) and rs345983 in Mastermind-like 3 (MAML3) replicated nominally; minor alleles of rs345983 and rs1344110 were associated with less severe BHR and higher lung tissue gene expression. PTTG1IP showed significant co-expression with pituitary tumour-transforming 1, the binding factor of PTTG1lP, and with vimentin and E-cadherin1. MAML3 co-expressed significantly with Mastermind-like 2 (MAML2), both involved in Notch signalling. Conclusions: PTTG1IP and MAML3 are associated with BHR severity in adult asthma. The relevance of these genes is supported by the eQTL analyses and co-expression of PTTG1lP with vimentin and E-cadherin1, and MAML3 with MAML2.},

Cancer deaths were obtained for the entire U.S. population. Cancer screening, risk factor, incidence, and mortality data were compiled for Latino and non-Latino adults and children (incidence only). Long-term (1975-2003) and fixed-interval (1995-2003) trends and comparative analyses by disease stage, urbanicity, and area poverty were evaluated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The long-term trend in overall cancer death rates, declining since the early 1990s, continued through 2003 for all races and both sexes combined. However, female lung cancer incidence rates increased from 1975 to 2003, decelerating since 1991 and breast cancer incidence rates stabilized from 2001 to 2003. Latinos had lower incidence rates in 1999-2003 for most cancers, but higher rates for stomach, liver, cervix, and myeloma (females) than did non-Latino white populations. Latino children have higher incidence of leukemia, retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma, and germ-cell tumors than do non-Latino white children. For several common cancers, Latinos were less likely than non-Latinos to be diagnosed at localized stages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The lower cancer rates observed in Latino immigrants could be sustained by maintenance of healthy behaviors. Some infection-related cancers in Latinos could be controlled by evidence-based interventions. Affordable, culturally sensitive, linguistically appropriate, and timely access to cancer information, prevention, screening, and treatment are important in Latino outreach and community networks.},

We conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis of the relationship between a vitamin D genetic risk score (GRS, range 0-10), comprised of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of vitamin D status in the DHCR7, CYP2R1 and GC genes and cancer risk among women. Analysis was performed in the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS), including 23,294 women of European ancestry who were cancer-free at baseline and followed for 20 years for incident cancer. In a subgroup of 1782 WGHS participants with 25OHD measures at baseline, the GRS was associated with circulating 25OHD mean (SD) = 67.8 (26.1) nmol/L, 56.9 (18.7) nmol/L in the lowest versus 73.2 (27.9) nmol/L in the highest quintile of the GRS (ptrend {\textless} 0.0001 across quintiles).

abstract = {The screening of many endpoints when comparing groups from different strains, searching for some statistically significant difference, raises the multiple comparisons problem in its most severe form. Using the 0.05 level to decide which of the many endpoints' differences are statistically significant, the probability of finding a difference to be significant even though it is not real increases far beyond 0.05. The traditional approach to this problem has been to control the probability of making even one such error - the Bonferroni procedure being the most familiar procedure achieving such control. However, the incurred loss of power stemming from such control led many practitioners to neglect multiplicity control altogether. The False Discovery Rate (FDR), suggested by Benjamini and Hochberg [J Royal Stat Soc Ser B 57 (1995) 289], is a new, different, and compromising point of view regarding the error in multiple comparisons. The FDR is the expected proportion of false discoveries among the discoveries, and controlling the FDR goes a long way towards controlling the increased error from multiplicity while losing less in the ability to discover real differences. In this paper we demonstrate the problem in two studies: the study of exploratory behavior [Behav Brain Res (2001)], and the study of the interaction of strain differences with laboratory environment [Science 284 (1999) 1670]. We explain the FDR criterion, and present two simple procedures that control the FDR. We demonstrate their increased power when used in the above two studies. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A genome-wide association study (GWAS) typically is focused on detecting marginal genetic effects. However, many complex traits are likely to be the result of the interplay of genes and environmental factors. These SNPs may have a weak marginal effect and thus unlikely to be detected from a scan of marginal effects, but may be detectable in a gene-environment (G × E) interaction analysis. However, a genome-wide interaction scan (GWIS) using a standard test of G × E interaction is known to have low power, particularly when one corrects for testing multiple SNPs. Two 2-step methods for GWIS have been previously proposed, aimed at improving efficiency by prioritizing SNPs most likely to be involved in a G × E interaction using a screening step. For a quantitative trait, these include a method that screens on marginal effects [Kooperberg and Leblanc, 2008] and a method that screens on variance heterogeneity by genotype [Par{\'{e}} et al., 2010] In this paper, we show that the Par{\'{e}} et al. approach has an inflated false-positive rate in the presence of an environmental marginal effect, and we propose an alternative that remains valid. We also propose a novel 2-step approach that combines the two screening approaches, and provide simulations demonstrating that the new method can outperform other GWIS approaches. Application of this method to a G × Hispanic-ethnicity scan for childhood lung function reveals a SNP near the MARCO locus that was not identified by previous marginal-effect scans.},

abstract = {Tools for estimating population structure from genetic data are now used in a wide variety of applications in population genetics. However, inferring population structure in large modern data sets imposes severe computational challenges. Here, we develop efficient algorithms for approximate inference of the model underlying the STRUCTURE program using a variational Bayesian framework. Variational methods pose the problem of computing relevant posterior distributions as an optimization problem, allowing us to build on recent advances in optimization theory to develop fast inference tools. In addition, we propose useful heuristic scores to identify the number of populations represented in a data set and a new hierarchical prior to detect weak population structure in the data. We test the variational algorithms on simulated data and illustrate using genotype data from the CEPH-Human Genome Diversity Panel. The variational algorithms are almost two orders of magnitude faster than STRUCTURE and achieve accuracies comparable to those of ADMIXTURE. Furthermore, our results show that the heuristic scores for choosing model complexity provide a reasonable range of values for the number of populations represented in the data, with minimal bias toward detecting structure when it is very weak. Our algorithm, fastSTRUCTURE, is freely available online at http://pritchardlab.stanford.edu/structure.html.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic amines (HCAs) are carcinogens formed in or on the surface of well-done meat, cooked at high temperature. METHODS We estimated breast cancer risk in relation to intake of cooked meat in a population-based, case-control study (1508 cases and 1556 controls) conducted in Long Island, NY from 1996 to 1997. Lifetime intakes of grilled or barbecued and smoked meats were derived from the interviewer-administered questionnaire data. Dietary intakes of PAH and HCA were derived from the self-administered modified Block food frequency questionnaire of intake 1 year before reference date. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS Modest increased risk was observed among postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, women consuming the most grilled or barbecued and smoked meats over the life course (OR = 1.47; CI = 1.12-1.92 for highest vs. lowest tertile of intake). Postmenopausal women with low fruit and vegetable intake, but high lifetime intake of grilled or barbecued and smoked meats, had a higher OR of 1.74 (CI = 1.20-2.50). No associations were observed with the food frequency questionnaire-derived intake measures of PAHs and HCAs, with the possible exception of benzo(alpha)pyrene from meat among postmenopausal women whose tumors were positive for both estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors (OR = 1.47; CI = 0.99-2.19). CONCLUSIONS These results support the accumulating evidence that consumption of meats cooked by methods that promote carcinogen formation may increase risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Few studies have examined recent shifts in meat consumption (MC), differences among US population groups, and the influence of psychosocial-behavioural factors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Nationally representative data collected for US adults aged {\textgreater}or=18 years in the 1988-1994 and 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the 1994-1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) and Diet and Health Knowledge Survey (DHKS) were used.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found a U-shaped trend in MC, a decrease between 1988-1994 and 1994-1996, and an increase from 1994-1996 to 1999-2004. NHANES 1988-1994 and 1999-2004 indicate that MC did not change significantly, particularly for all meat, red meat, poultry and seafood. Between 1994-1996 and 1999-2004, average MC, including red meat, poultry, seafood and other meat products, increased in men. Women's total MC decreased, mainly due to decreased red meat and other meat products, except for increased seafood. Noticeable differences existed in the changes across population groups. Black men had the largest increase in consumption of total meat, poultry and seafood; Mexican American men had the smallest increase in poultry, seafood and other meat products. In 1999-2004, ethnic differences in MC became greater in women than among women in 1994-1996. Associations between MC and energy intake changed over time. Perceived benefit of dietary quality and food label use were associated with reduced red MC.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Noticeable differences exist in the shifts in MC across population groups and surveys. MC increased in men but decreased in women in recent years.},

This study examined associations of breast cancer with sun exposure, the principal source of vitamin D, and vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) polymorphisms (FokI, TaqI, BglI) in a population-based case-control study of Hispanic, African-American, and non-Hispanic White women aged 35-79 years from the San Francisco Bay Area of California (1995-2003). In-person interviews were obtained for 1,788 newly diagnosed cases and 2,129 controls. Skin pigmentation measurements were taken on the upper underarm (a sun-protected site that measures constitutive pigmentation) and on the forehead (a sun-exposed site) using reflectometry. Biospecimens were collected for a subset of the study population (814 cases, 910 controls). A high sun exposure index based on reflectometry was associated with reduced risk of advanced breast cancer among women with light constitutive skin pigmentation (odds ratio = 0.53, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.31, 0.91). The association did not vary with VDR genotype. No associations were found for women with medium or dark pigmentation. Localized breast cancer was not associated with sun exposure or VDR genotype. This study supports the hypothesis that sunlight exposure reduces risk of advanced breast cancer among women with light skin pigmentation.},

abstract = {Excessive exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) often results in lung cancer, a disease with the highest cancer mortality in the United States. After entry into the lung, PAHs induce phase I metabolic enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenases, i.e. CYP1A1/2 and 1B1, and phase II enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases, UDP glucuronyl transferases, NADPH quinone oxidoreductases (NQOs), aldo-keto reductases (AKRs), and epoxide hydrolases (EHs), via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent and independent pathways. Humans can also be exposed to PAHs through diet, via consumption of charcoal broiled foods. Metabolism of PAHs through the CYP1A1/1B1/EH pathway, CYP peroxidase pathway, and AKR pathway leads to the formation of the active carcinogens diol-epoxides, radical cations, and o-quinones. These reactive metabolites produce DNA adducts, resulting in DNA mutations, alteration of gene expression profiles, and tumorigenesis. Mutations in xenobiotic metabolic enzymes, as well as polymorphisms of tumor suppressor genes (e.g. p53) and/or genes involved in gene expression (e.g. X-ray repair cross-complementing proteins), are associated with lung cancer susceptibility in human populations from different ethnicities, gender, and age groups. Although various metabolic activation/inactivation pathways, AhR signaling, and genetic susceptibilities contribute to lung cancer, the precise points at which PAHs induce tumor initiation remain unknown. The goal of this review is to provide a current state-of-the-science of the mechanisms of human lung carcinogenesis mediated by PAHs, the experimental approaches used to study this complex class of compounds, and future directions for research of these compounds.},

abstract = {Many GWAS have identified novel loci associated with common diseases, but have focused only on main effects of individual genetic variants rather than interactions with environmental factors (GxE). Identification of GxE interactions is particularly important for coronary heart disease (CHD), a major preventable source of morbidity and mortality with strong non-genetic risk factors. Atherosclerosis is the major cause of CHD, and coronary artery calcification (CAC) is directly correlated with quantity of coronary atherosclerotic plaque. In the current study, we tested for genetic variants influencing extent of CAC via interaction with smoking (GxS), by conducting a GxS discovery GWAS in Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) sibships (N = 915 European Americans) followed by replication in Framingham Heart Study (FHS) sibships (N = 1025 European Americans). Generalized estimating equations accounted for the correlation within sibships in strata-specific groups of smokers and nonsmokers, as well as GxS interaction. Primary analysis found SNPs that showed suggestive associations (p≤10(-5)) in GENOA GWAS, but these index SNPs did not replicate in FHS. However, secondary analysis was able to replicate candidate gene regions in FHS using other SNPs (+/-250 kb of GENOA index SNP). In smoker and nonsmoker groups, replicated genes included TCF7L2 (p = 6.0×10(-5)) and WWOX (p = 4.5×10(-6)); and TNFRSF8 (p = 7.8×10(-5)), respectively. For GxS interactions, replicated genes included TBC1D4 (p = 6.9×10(-5)) and ADAMTS9 (P = 7.1×10(-5)). Interestingly, these genes are involved in inflammatory pathways mediated by the NF-$\kappa$B axis. Since smoking is known to induce chronic and systemic inflammation, association of these genes likely reflects roles in CAC development via inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, the NF-$\kappa$B axis regulates bone remodeling, a key physiological process in CAC development. In conclusion, GxS GWAS has yielded evidence for novel loci that are associated with CAC via interaction with smoking, providing promising new targets for future population-based and functional studies of CAC development.},

abstract = {The ethnic and geographic distributions of several common chronic diseases show distinct patterns that are consistent with the distribution of genes and genetic admixture. For example, diabetes and gallbladder disease occur most frequently among Amerindians, while those genetically admixed with them (such as Mexican-Americans) have intermediate rates, and lowest rates are found among Whites and Blacks. Because there will be heterogeneity from individual to individual in ancestral affinity within an admixed population, a method is developed for estimating each person's admixture probability. Results confirm that there is substantial heterogeneity of individual admixture among Mexican-Americans in Starr County, Texas, with a mean value indicating that 65{\%} of genes in this population are Caucasian derived and 35{\%} Amerindian derived. The individual estimates are shown to be unrelated to the probability of being diabetic and only marginally related to gallbladder disease, with those having the most Amerindian affinity being at increased risk. These results are a consequence of the independent assortment of loci and indicate that unless the markers employed are related (including linkage) to the disease of interest, the method will have limited utility. Individual admixture estimates will be useful, however, for examining aspects of population structure and will find increased utility for predicting disease and examining disease associations as more and more of the genome is represented by markers, a very probable prospect with the abundance of DNA polymorphism being identified by restriction enzymes.},

abstract = {It is increasingly recognized that pathway analyses-a joint test of association between the outcome and a group of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a biological pathway-could potentially complement single-SNP analysis and provide additional insights for the genetic architecture of complex diseases. Building upon existing P-value combining methods, we propose a class of highly flexible pathway analysis approaches based on an adaptive rank truncated product statistic that can effectively combine evidence of associations over different SNPs and genes within a pathway. The statistical significance of the pathway-level test statistics is evaluated using a highly efficient permutation algorithm that remains computationally feasible irrespective of the size of the pathway and complexity of the underlying test statistics for summarizing SNP- and gene-level associations. We demonstrate through simulation studies that a gene-based analysis that treats the underlying genes, as opposed to the underlying SNPs, as the basic units for hypothesis testing, is a very robust and powerful approach to pathway-based association testing. We also illustrate the advantage of the proposed methods using a study of the association between the nicotinic receptor pathway and cigarette smoking behaviors.},

abstract = {Scanning the genome for association between markers and complex diseases typically requires testing hundreds of thousands of genetic polymorphisms. Testing such a large number of hypotheses exacerbates the trade-off between power to detect meaningful associations and the chance of making false discoveries. Even before the full genome is scanned, investigators often favor certain regions on the basis of the results of prior investigations, such as previous linkage scans. The remaining regions of the genome are investigated simultaneously because genotyping is relatively inexpensive compared with the cost of recruiting participants for a genetic study and because prior evidence is rarely sufficient to rule out these regions as harboring genes with variation of conferring liability (liability genes). However, the multiple testing inherent in broad genomic searches diminishes power to detect association, even for genes falling in regions of the genome favored a priori. Multiple testing problems of this nature are well suited for application of the false-discovery rate (FDR) principle, which can improve power. To enhance power further, a new FDR approach is proposed that involves weighting the hypotheses on the basis of prior data. We present a method for using linkage data to weight the association P values. Our investigations reveal that if the linkage study is informative, the procedure improves power considerably. Remarkably, the loss in power is small, even when the linkage study is uninformative. For a class of genetic models, we calculate the sample size required to obtain useful prior information from a linkage study. This inquiry reveals that, among genetic models that are seemingly equal in genetic information, some are much more promising than others for this mode of analysis.},

abstract = {The association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) has been acknowledged for almost a century and is assumedly promoted by a chronic inflammation-driven carcinogenic process in the intestine in combination with a genetic predisposition. The magnitude of the risk of CRC in IBD remains a continuing subject of debate. The early, high risk estimates for CRC in IBD were most likely overestimated due to selected patient populations originating from tertiary referral centers with a disproportional high percentage of patients with severe disease. Later population-based studies calculating risk estimates from a broad spectrum of IBD patients have found the risk to be significantly lower. At present, there is evidence that IBD patients with longstanding and extensive disease with uncontrolled inflammation are those at increased risk. Additional, other recognized risk factors include early age at onset, family history of CRC, and concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis. A significant amount of effort is put into identifying potential preventive factors of CRC in IBD, including surveillance programs and chemopreventive agents but the individual effect of these remains uncertain. Interestingly, recent studies have reported a decline in risk of CRC over time. Surveillance programs and the new treatment strategies, particular biological treatment might be part of the reason for the observed decline in risk of CRC in IBD over time but future studies will have investigate this assumption.},

CD44, a cell surface glycoprotein, is involved in many cellular processes including cell adhesion, migration and proliferation. However, whether and how the two molecules interact in breast cancer is not clear. In recent years, the up-regulation of CD44 has served as a marker for tumor initiating cells in breast cancer and other cancer types. Despite the important role of CD44 in cellular processes and cancer, the mechanism underlying CD44 up-regulation in cancers remains poorly understood. Previously, we have identified a novel cis-element, CR1, located upstream of the CD44 promoter. We demonstrated that NF-$\kappa$B and AP-1 are key trans-acting factors that interact with CR1. Here, we further analyzed the role of NF-$\kappa$B in regulating CD44 expression in triple negative breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 and SUM159. Inhibition of NF-$\kappa$B by Bay-11-7082 resulted in a reduction in CD44 expression. CD44 repression via NF-$\kappa$B inhibition consequently decreased proliferation and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. These findings provide not only new insight into the molecular mechanism underlying CD44 regulation but also potential therapeutic targets that may help eliminate chemo- and radiation-resistant cancer cells.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effect of meat consumption and cigarette smoking in combination with N-acetyltransferases 1 and 2 (NAT1 and NAT2), and glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) genotypes on colorectal cancer. METHODS: From a Dutch prospective study, after 8.5 years of follow-up, data of 102 incident colorectal cancer cases and a random sample of 537 controls frequency-matched for gender and age were analyzed. Baseline information on dietary and smoking habits, as well as blood samples for DNA isolation and genotyping, were available. RESULTS: Red meat intake increased colorectal cancer risk among men (OR 2.7; 95{\%} CI 1.1-6.7 highest vs. lowest intake), whereas poultry and fish decreased risk among women (OR 0.5; 95{\%} CI 0.2-1.07). Cigarette smoking for at least 16 years increased colorectal cancer risk among former smokers only (OR 2.7; 95{\%} CI 1.0-7.4), compared to those having smoked for 15 years or less. NAT1 and NAT2 polymorphisms did not significantly modify these associations. High consumption of poultry and fish was inversely associated with colorectal cancer only in the presence of GSTM1. CONCLUSIONS: In this study meat consumption and former long-term smoking were associated with colorectal cancer. Associations of colorectal cancer with different types of meat were modified by gender and GSTM1 genotype.},

Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs13387042 (2q35) and rs1219648 (FGFR2 gene), were found to be associated with breast cancer risk. Risk increased nearly linearly with number of affected risk alleles, with a two-fold elevated risk for women homozygous for the risk alleles in both SNPs. No additional significant associations, however, were identified for the other 9 loci evaluated in the study.

abstract = {Background: Both age and race have been identified as independent predictors of breast cancer subtype but the association of age with subtype within each race is not well understood. This study assesses the association of age with the eight breast cancer subtypes as defined by ER/PR/HER2 among white, African-American, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander women. Methods: This study included 69,358 women with primary invasive breast cancer. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of age with each of the ER/PR/HER2 subtypes for each race adjusted for socioeconomic status, stage, grade, and tumor size. Results: The odds of African-American women having a triple-negative tumor were not statistically significantly increased for women under 46 when compared to the African-American women aged 46-69 (OR. = 0.96; 95{\%} CI. = 0.80-1.16). A similar pattern was observed for the ER-/PR-/HER2+ subtype. Hispanic women under age 46 (OR. = 0.83; 95{\%} CI. = 0.71-0.97) and over age 70 (OR. = 0.71; 95{\%} CI. = 0.57-0.89) were less likely to have the ER-/PR-/HER2+ subtype. Asian/Pacific Islander women under age 46 also had reduced odds (OR. = 0.67; 95{\%} CI. = 0.55-0.82) of the ER-/PR-/HER2+ subtype. Conclusions: The ER/PR/HER2 subtypes vary with age and differences in this variation depend on race. It is important to define breast cancer using the ER/PR/HER2 subtype and the significance of age and race should not be overlooked. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Familial clustering studies indicate that breast cancer risk has a substantial genetic component. To identify new breast cancer risk variants, we genotyped approximately 300,000 SNPs in 1,600 Icelandic individuals with breast cancer and 11,563 controls using the Illumina Hap300 platform. We then tested selected SNPs in five replication sample sets. Overall, we studied 4,554 affected individuals and 17,577 controls. Two SNPs consistently associated with breast cancer: approximately 25{\%} of individuals of European descent are homozygous for allele A of rs13387042 on chromosome 2q35 and have an estimated 1.44-fold greater risk than noncarriers, and for allele T of rs3803662 on 16q12, about 7{\%} are homozygous and have a 1.64-fold greater risk. Risk from both alleles was confined to estrogen receptor-positive tumors. At present, no genes have been identified in the linkage disequilibrium block containing rs13387042. rs3803662 is near the 5' end of TNRC9 , a high mobility group chromatin-associated protein whose expression is implicated in breast cancer metastasis to bone.},

abstract = {Mouse Pde4d is located on chromosome 13 and serves many functions in important physiological processes involving cyclic adenosine monophosphate. In this study, imprinting analysis indicated that Pde4d exhibits a dynamic and specific allelic expression pattern during embryo development. This showed paternal-origin sex bias in embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) whole embryos and placenta, and biallelic expression in the major embryonic organs and placenta at E15.5. In situ hybridization determined the spatiotemporal expression pattern of Pde4d in mouse embryos from the mid- to late-embryonic stages. This demonstrated that Pde4d was widely expressed in the neural tissues, including the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and neural tube, at the mid-embryonic stage. By the late-embryonic stage, Pde4d was extensively detected throughout the developing organism, including in the liver, brain, lung, kidney, and tongue. In addition, methylation analyses indicated that tissue-specific CpG methylation of the Pde4d promoter was correlated with Pde4d mRNA expression in major E15.5 tissues. Furthermore, stage-specific CpG methylation of the Pde4d promoter was associated with gene expression in the liver at three developmental stages. Our results suggest that Pde4d might serve specific biological functions in regulating the development process of the mouse embryo, and that CpG methylation of the Pde4d promoter may play an important role in regulating Pde4d at a transcriptional level. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Vitamin B12 (B12; also known as cobalamin) is a B vitamin that has an important role in cellular metabolism, especially in DNA synthesis, methylation and mitochondrial metabolism. Clinical B12 deficiency with classic haematological and neurological manifestations is relatively uncommon. However, subclinical deficiency affects between 2.5{\%} and 26{\%} of the general population depending on the definition used, although the clinical relevance is unclear. B12 deficiency can affect individuals at all ages, but most particularly elderly individuals. Infants, children, adolescents and women of reproductive age are also at high risk of deficiency in populations where dietary intake of B12-containing animal-derived foods is restricted. Deficiency is caused by either inadequate intake, inadequate bioavailability or malabsorption. Disruption of B12 transport in the blood, or impaired cellular uptake or metabolism causes an intracellular deficiency. Diagnostic biomarkers for B12 status include decreased levels of circulating total B12 and transcobalamin-bound B12, and abnormally increased levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid. However, the exact cut-offs to classify clinical and subclinical deficiency remain debated. Management depends on B12 supplementation, either via high-dose oral routes or via parenteral administration. This Primer describes the current knowledge surrounding B12 deficiency, and highlights improvements in diagnostic methods as well as shifting concepts about the prevalence, causes and manifestations of B12 deficiency.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of review articles and meta-analysis has become an important part of epidemiological research, mainly for reconciling previously conducted studies that have inconsistent results. Numerous methodologic issues particularly with respect to biases and the use of meta-analysis are still controversial. METHODS: Four methods summarizing data from epidemiological studies are described. The rationale for meta-analysis and the statistical methods used are outlined. The strengths and limitations of these methods are compared particularly with respect to their ability to investigate heterogeneity between studies and to provide quantitative risk estimation. RESULTS: Meta-analyses from published data are in general insufficient to calculate a pooled estimate since published estimates are based on heterogeneous populations, different study designs and mainly different statistical models. More reliable results can be expected if individual data are available for a pooled analysis, although some heterogeneity still remains. Large prospective planned meta-analysis of multicentre studies would be preferable to investigate small risk factors, however this type of meta-analysis is expensive and time-consuming. CONCLUSION: For a full assessment of risk factors with a high prevalence in the general population, pooling of data will become increasingly important. Future research needs to focus on the deficiencies of review methods, in particular, the errors and biases that can be produced when studies are combined that have used different designs, methods and analytic models.},

Here we introduce a powerful strategy that integrates gene expression measurements with summary association statistics from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genes whose cis-regulated expression is associated with complex traits. We leverage expression imputation from genetic data to perform a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) to identify significant expression-trait associations. We applied our approaches to expression data from blood and adipose tissue measured in ∼3,000 individuals overall. We imputed gene expression into GWAS data from over 900,000 phenotype measurements to identify 69 new genes significantly associated with obesity-related traits (BMI, lipids and height). Many of these genes are associated with relevant phenotypes in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel. Our results showcase the power of integrating genotype, gene expression and phenotype to gain insights into the genetic basis of complex traits.},

abstract = {Red and processed meat intake is associated with increased risks of both colorectal adenoma and cancer. Processed meats contain nitrate and nitrite, precursors of N-nitroso compounds (NOCs); furthermore, meats cooked at high temperatures contain heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Specific NOC, HCA and PAH are mutagens and animal carcinogens. We conducted a case-control study of 146 cases of colorectal adenoma, diagnosed at sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and 228 polyp-free controls. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) [and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs)] and found a 2-fold increased risk in the highest, compared with the lowest, quartile of processed meat intake (95{\%} CI = 1.0-4.0). We estimated nitrate and nitrite intake from meat using published data from the literature as well as from actual measurements of meats analyzed recently. We evaluated the interaction of processed meat and nitrate plus nitrite intake with CYP2A6 activity, an enzyme able to metabolize some NOC to their carcinogenic form. Results for both methods of estimating nitrate and nitrite intake were similar; compared with the lowest, the highest quartile based on measured values was associated with a 2-fold elevated risk (95{\%} CI = 1.0-3.9). Adjustment for the HCA 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) attenuated the association (OR = 1.6, 95{\%} CI = 0.8-3.2), but other HCA and PAH had minimal effect. Higher CYP2A6 activity was not associated with risk and there was no evidence of an interaction of CYP2A6 activity with nitrate and nitrite intake. Our results suggest that nitrite and nitrate intake from processed meat intake increases the risk of colorectal adenoma after accounting for HCA and PAH.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are determining factors in the immune and inflammatory responses to tumors cells. Experimental data suggest that interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 play important roles in the development and progression of breast cancer. We designed a broad study to investigate the susceptibility and prognostic implications of the genetic variation in IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 in breast carcinoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used the polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion to characterize the genetic variation of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 in 305, unrelated Tunisian patients with breast carcinoma and 200 healthy control subjects. Associations between the genetic markers and the clinicopathological parameters, the specific overall survival rate (OVS) of breast carcinoma and the disease free-survival rate (DFS) were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Both IL-6 (-597) GA and IL-6 (-174) GC heterozygous genotypes were found to be significantly associated with breast carcinoma (OR = 1.59, p = 0.024 and OR = 1.61, p = 0.022 respectively). A highly significant association was found between the (+3954) T allele of IL1-B gene and the aggressive phenotype of breast carcinoma as defined by the high histological grade, axillary lymph node metastasis and large tumor size. The IL-1alpha (-889) TT homozygous genotype showed a significant association with reduced disease-free survival and/or overall survival rate. The IL-1beta (+3954) TT, IL-6 (-597) GG and IL-6 (-174) GG homozygous genotypes were found to be associated with reduced DFS but not with overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphisms in the promoter region of the IL-6 gene may represent a marker for the increased risk of breast carcinoma. Genetic variations in IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 may predict the clinical outcome of breast carcinoma.},

abstract = {Endogenous formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOCs), which are known animal carcinogens, could contribute to human carcinogenesis but definitive evidence is still lacking. To investigate the relevance of NOCs in human colorectal cancer (CRC) development, we analyzed whole genome gene expression modifications in human colon biopsies in relation to fecal NOC exposure. We had a particular interest in patients suffering from intestinal inflammation as this may stimulate endogenous NOC formation, and consequently predispose to CRC risk. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome patients without inflammation, serving as controls, were therefore recruited. Fecal NOC were demonstrated in the majority of subjects. By associating gene expression levels of all subjects to fecal NOC levels, we identified a NOC exposure-associated transcriptomic response that suggests that physiological NOC concentrations may potentially induce genotoxic responses and chromatin modifications in human colon tissue, both of which are linked to carcinogenicity. In a network analysis, chromatin modifications were linked to 11 significantly modulated histone genes, pointing towards a possible epigenetic mechanism that may be relevant in comprehending NOC-induced carcinogenesis. In addition, pro-inflammatory transcriptomic modifications were identified in visually non-inflamed regions of the IBD colon. However, fecal NOC levels were slightly but not significantly increased in IBD patients, suggesting that inflammation did not strongly stimulate NOC formation. We conclude that NOC exposure is associated with gene expression modifications in the human colon that may suggest a potential role of these compounds in CRC development. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

The findings have demonstrated the existence of at least three pathways: chromosomal instability, microsatellite instability and CpG island methylator phenotype. Importantly, new studies have shown that inflammation and microRNAs contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis. Recent data have demonstrated that several genetic and epigenetic changes are important in determining patient prognosis and survival. Furthermore, some of these mechanisms are related to patients' response to drugs, such as aspirin, which could be used for both chemoprevention and treatment in specific settings. Thus, in the near future, we could be able to predict disease behavior based on molecular markers found on tumors, and direct the best treatment options for patients.},

Knowledge of the biological role of such shared proteins in one organism can often be transferred to other organisms. The goal of the Gene Ontology Consortium is to produce a dynamic, controlled vocabulary that can be applied to all eukaryotes even as knowledge of gene and protein roles in cells is accumulating and changing. To this end, three independent ontologies accessible on the World-Wide Web (http://www.geneontology.org) are being constructed: biological process, molecular function and cellular component.},

In this article, we elucidate general conditions that are required for validity and power of these procedures, and we propose extensions of two-stage procedures using the case-only estimator of gene-treatment interaction in randomized clinical trials. We develop a unified estimating equation approach to proving asymptotic independence between a filtering statistic and an interaction test statistic in a range of situations, including marginal association and interaction in a generalized linear model with a canonical link. We assess the performance of various two-stage procedures in simulations and in genetic studies from Women's Health Initiative clinical trials.},

@article{Pierce2018,
abstract = {Purpose of review In this paper, we summarize prior studies that have used Mendelian Randomization (MR) methods to study the effects of exposures, lifestyle factors, physical traits, and/or biomarkers on cancer risk in humans. Many such risk factors have been associated with cancer risk in observational studies, and the MR approach can be used to provide evidence as to whether these associations represent causal relationships. MR methods require a risk factor of interest to have known genetic determinants that can be used as proxies for the risk factor (i.e., "instrumental variables" or IVs), and these can be used to obtain an effect estimate that, under certain assumptions, is not prone to bias caused by unobserved confounding or reverse causality. This review seeks to describe how MR studies have contributed to our understanding of cancer causation. Recent findings We searched the published literature and identified 76 MR studies of cancer risk published prior to October 31, 2017. Risk factors commonly studied included alcohol consumption, Vitamin D, anthropometric traits, telomere length, lipid traits, glycemic traits, and markers of inflammation. Risk factors showing compelling evidence of a causal association with risk for at least one cancer type include alcohol consumption (for head/neck and colorectal), adult body mass index (increases risk for multiple cancers, but decreases risk for breast), height (increases risk for breast, colorectal, and lung; decreases risk for esophageal), telomere length (increases risk for lung adenocarcinoma, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, glioma, B-cell lymphoma subtypes, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and neuroblastoma), and hormonal factors (affects risk for sex-steroid sensitive cancers). Summary This review highlights alcohol consumption, body mass index, height, telomere length, and the hormonal exposures as factors likely to contribute to cancer causation. This review also highlights the need to study specific cancer types, ideally subtypes, as the effects of risk factors can be heterogeneous across cancer types. As consortia-based genome-wide association studies increase in sample size and analytical methods for MR continue to become more sophisticated, MR will become an increasingly powerful tool for understanding cancer causation.},

Re-sequencing this segment in European subjects identified 293 common polymorphisms, including a set of 26 highly correlated candidate causal variants. By evaluation of these SNPs in five breast cancer case-control studies involving more than 23 000 subjects from populations of European and Southeast Asian ancestry, all but 14 variants could be excluded at odds of {\textless}1:100. Most of the remaining variants lie in the intergenic region, which exhibits evolutionary conservation and open chromatin conformation, consistent with a regulatory function.

Recent reports show that, in the US, it was the most frequent form of cancer among persons aged 75 years and older. Given that the majority of cancers occur in elder people and with the ageing of the population in mind, this observation gives further impetus to investigating prevention and treat-ment strategies among this subgroup of the population. Screening research, recommendations and implementation is an obvious priority. While there are many questions to be resolved, it is apparent that many facets of colorectal cancer are becoming increasingly understood and prospects for prevention are becoming apparent. Achieving colorectal cancer control is the immediate challenge.

abstract = {Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are members of an enzyme family that require a zinc ion in their active site for catalytic activity. MMPs are critical for maintaining tissue allostasis. MMPs are active at neutral pH and can therefore catalyze the normal turnover of extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules such as the interstitial and basement membrane collagens, proteoglycans such as aggrecan, decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin and versican as well as accessory ECM proteins such as fibronectin. Members of the MMP family include the "classical" MMPs, the membrane-bound MMPs (MT-MMPs) the ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; adamlysins) and the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif). There are more than 20 members in the MMP and ADAMTS family including the collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, some elastases and aggrecanases. Adamlysins are membrane-bound MMPs that also degrade aggrecan, but more importantly, one ADAM family member (i.e.ADAM-17) is a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-converting enzyme (TACE) that activates pro-TNF-alpha. Most of the MMPs are synthesized as inactive latent enzymes. Conversion to the active enzyme is generally mediated by activator systems that include plasminogen activator or the pro-hormone convertase, furin. MMP activity is regulated by a group of endogenous proteins, called, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) that bind to active and alternative sites of the activated MMP. Significant advances have occurred in the understanding of the regulation of MMPs, ADAMs and ADAMTSs gene expression. In addition, development of MMP inhibitors to study MMP structure/function relationships spawned many studies to determine the effectiveness of MMP inhibitors in regulating abnormal connective tissue turnover. In addition, development of MMP null mice carrying specific MMP deletions has provided an opportunity to explore the role of MMPs in normal development as well as in such diverse conditions and diseases as skeletal dysplasias, coronary artery and heart disease, arthritis, cancer, and brain disorders.},

The latest version of PANTHER, 10.0, includes almost 5000 new protein families (for a total of over 12 000 families), each with a reference phylogenetic tree including protein-coding genes from 104 fully sequenced genomes spanning all kingdoms of life. Phylogenetic trees now include inference of horizontal transfer events in addition to speciation and gene duplication events. Functional annotations are regularly updated using the models generated by the Gene Ontology Phylogenetic Annotation Project. For the data analysis tools, PANTHER has expanded the number of different 'functional annotation sets' available for functional enrichment testing, allowing analyses to access all Gene Ontology annotations-updated monthly from the Gene Ontology database-in addition to the annotations that have been inferred through evolutionary relationships. The Prowler (data browser) has been updated to enable users to more efficiently browse the entire database, and to create custom gene lists using the multiple axes of classification in PANTHER.},

We investigated the effect of differences in acetylation capacity, determined by NAT1 and NAT2 genotypes, on colorectal cancer risk associated with exposure to tobacco smoke or red meat consumption. In this population-based case-control study in Germany, 505 patients with incident colorectal cancer and 604 age- and sex-matched control individuals with genotyping data and detailed risk factor information were included. Genotyping of NAT1 and NAT2 genetic polymorphisms was done using a fluorescence-based melting curve analysis method. The association between genotypes, environmental exposures, and colorectal cancer risk was estimated using multivariate logistic regression. Colorectal cancer risk associated with active smoking was elevated after accumulation of 30(+) pack-years of smoking [odds ratio (OR), 1.4; 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI), 0.9-2.2] but not significantly modified by either NAT1 or NAT2 genotype. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke was associated with an increased risk for colorectal cancer only among NAT2 fast acetylators (OR, 2.6; 95{\%} CI, 1.1-5.9 for exposure in childhood and adulthood). Frequent consumption of red meat significantly increased colorectal cancer risk for the group comprising all NAT2 fast acetylators or carriers of the NAT1*10 allele (OR, 2.6; 95{\%} CI, 1.1-6.1) but not among those with "slow" NAT1 and NAT2 genotypes. Our findings indicate that NAT1 and NAT2 genotypes may contribute jointly to individual susceptibility and that heterocyclic aromatic amines may play an important role in colorectal cancer associated with red meat and possibly also exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.},

We compared Hispanic and non-Hispanic white (NHW) cases for stage of disease, estrogen receptor (ER) status, tumor size, and lymph node status, and the associations of these with body size in the 4-Corners Breast Cancer Study. Methods: One thousand five hundred twenty-seven NHW and 798 Hispanic primary incident breast cancer cases diagnosed between October 1999 and May 2004 were included. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression. Results: Hispanic women were more likely to have larger ({\textgreater}1 cm) ER- tumors and more than four positive lymph nodes (P {\textless} .003). Lymph node status was not associated with body size. However, among NHW women, obesity (body mass index {\textgreater}30) and increased waist circumference ({\textgreater}38.5 inches) were significantly positively associated with ER- tumor status (OR, 1.87; 95{\%} CI, 1.24-2.81 and OR, 2.59; 95{\%} CI, 1.58-4.22, respectively). In contrast, among Hispanic women, obesity and waist circumference had inverse associations with ER- tumor status (OR, 0.49; 95{\%} CI, 0.29-0.84 and OR, 0.56; 95{\%} CI, 0.30-1.05, respectively).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 recommends that Americans increase their intake of dairy products. However, some studies have reported that increasing dairy product intake is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine associations between intakes of calcium and dairy products and the risk of prostate cancer. METHODS: We searched Medline for prospective studies published in English-language journals from 1966 through May 2005. We identified 12 publications that used total, advanced, or fatal prostate cancer as end points and reported associations as relative risks (RRs) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) by category of dairy product or calcium intake. Data were extracted using standardized data forms. Random-effects models were used to pool study results and to assess dose-response relationships between dairy product or calcium intakes and the risk of prostate cancer. We conducted sensitivity analyses by changing criteria for inclusion of studies or by using fixed-effects models. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Men with the highest intake of dairy products (RR =1.11 [95{\%} CI = 1.00 to 1.22], P = .047) and calcium (RR = 1.39 [95{\%} CI = 1.09 to 1.77], P = .018) were more likely to develop prostate cancer than men with the lowest intake. Dose-response analyses suggested that dairy product and calcium intakes were each positively associated with the risk of prostate cancer (Ptrend = .029 and .014, respectively). Sensitivity analyses generally supported these associations, although the statistical significance was attenuated. The pooled relative risks of advanced prostate cancer were 1.33 (95{\%} CI = 1.00 to 1.78; P = .055) for the highest versus lowest intake categories of dairy products and 1.46 (95{\%} CI = 0.65 to 3.25; P {\textgreater} .2) for the highest versus lowest intake categories of calcium. CONCLUSIONS: High intake of dairy products and calcium may be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, although the increase appears to be small.},

abstract = {To meet the objectives for dietary assessment in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) prospective study, we developed a dietary history to provide accurate and reliable quantitative data on habitual individual nutrient intakes at baseline. The CARDIA dietary history was an interviewer-administered method that included a short questionnaire regarding general dietary practices followed by a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire about typical intake of foods using the previous month as a reference for recall. For each broad category of foods, participants were questioned in detail about specific foods only if they indicated that they consumed foods from that category. Follow-up questions for selected foods concerned serving size, frequency of consumption, and common additions to these foods. Provision was made for reporting foods not found in the food frequency list. The interview took approximately 45 minutes. Cue cards prompted responses and plastic food models assisted in estimating usual amounts consumed. A precoded format standardized coding for reported items and established the detail needed for recall during the interview. Baseline nutrient analyses from the CARDIA dietary history provided estimates that agreed reasonably well with expected caloric intake for body mass index according to the age- and sex-specific Recommended Dietary Allowances, but were higher than those reported from 24-hour recalls for comparable age, sex, and race groups in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The CARDIA dietary history is a comprehensive assessment tool that can provide a dietitian with detailed information regarding habitual eating patterns and nutrient intakes among adults.},

RESULTS: Protective effect of a late age at menarche, a longer period of breast-feeding, increased levels of: recreational physical activity, total vegetables or fruits intake, and intake of vitamins on the risk of breast cancer was observed among both pre- and post-menopausal women. Familial history of breast cancer, active or passive smoking, experience of a crude psychological stress were positively associated with breast cancer regardless menopausal status. Current body weight, current body mass index, increased alcohol intake elevated breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women, while these factors did not alter risk among premenopausal women. Increased consumption of red meat or animal fats elevated the risk in premenopausal women. More educated premenopausal women had lower breast cancer than those graduated from elementary school. Low family income increased the risk in premenopausal women. CONCLUSION: There is evidence for a dose-response relationship between several lifestyle factors and breast cancer risk. The results also suggest that some different mechanisms may operate in breast cancer etiology in pre-and post-menopausal women. A multifactorial process of breast cancer development, the complex interaction between physical activity, diet, energy intake and body weight, inconsistent and inconclusive data on breast cancer risk factors coming even from well-designed epidemiological studies are the case for continual update knowledge on primary prevention and identification of changes in behavior that will reduce the risk.},

abstract = {Background: High calcium intake is consistently associated with increased prostate cancer risk in epidemiologic studies. We previously reported that the positive association between calcium intake and risk of aggressive prostate cancer was modified by the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CDX-2 binding site of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene, among African American men. Methods: We expanded our previous study to include White men, a population with a higher calcium intake and a higher prevalence of the low absorption allele. We also examined VDR polymorphisms at other loci unrelated to calcium absorption. The study included 1,857 prostate cancer cases (1,140 with advanced stage at diagnosis, 717 with localized stage) and 1,096 controls. OR were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Results: Among both Blacks and Whites, we observed a threshold for calcium intake (604 mg/d) below which prostate cancer risk declined sharply. Low calcium intake was most strongly associated with decreased risk among men with the VDR Cdx2 low calcium absorption genotype (P for interaction = 0.001 and P = 0.06 for Whites and African Americans, respectively). Among all men with this genotype, those in the lowest quartile of calcium intake ({\textless}=604 mg/d) had a 50{\%} reduction in risk as compared with those in the upper three quartiles [OR = 0.49; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.36-0.67]. The association between calcium intake and prostate cancer risk was not modified by genotype at other VDR loci. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that genetic determinants of calcium absorption influence prostate cancer risk. Impact: The differences between African Americans and Whites in calcium absorption and dietary calcium intake may contribute to racial disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates. {\textcopyright}2012 AACR.},

Most of the cancer statistics available both at the state and national levels report cancer statistics for all Hispanics as an aggregate group. The goal of this paper is to provide a population-based overview of cancer mortality among Hispanics (Cubans, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans and other Hispanics) in Florida from 1990 to 2000 and to explore the demographic diversity of this growing ethnic group. The study population consisted of Hispanics and White non-Hispanics who died from cancer. Cancer mortality rates and proportion of cancer deaths by type and age at death for the selected racial/ethnic groups were calculated. Our findings indicate that the cancer death rates of the Hispanic subgroups compared favorably with those of White non-Hispanics and that cancer rates often presented for all Hispanics mask important differences between the different ethnic subgroups that fall under the Hispanic umbrella.

abstract = {Background When studying the genetics of a human trait, we typically have to manage both genome-wide and targeted genotype data. There can be overlap of both people and markers from different genotyping experiments; the overlap can introduce several kinds of problems. Most times the overlapping genotypes are the same, but sometimes they are different. Occasionally, the lab will return genotypes using a different allele labeling scheme (for example 1/2 vs A/C). Sometimes, the genotype for a person/marker index is unreliable or missing. Further, over time some markers are merged and bad samples are re-run under a different sample name. We need a consistent picture of the subset of data we have chosen to work with even though there might possibly be conflicting measurements from multiple data sources. Results We have developed the dbVOR database, which is designed to hold data efficiently for both genome-wide and targeted experiments. The data are indexed for fast retrieval by person and marker. In addition, we store pedigree and phenotype data for our subjects. The dbVOR database allows us to select subsets of the data by several different criteria and to merge their results into a coherent and consistent whole. Data may be filtered by: family, person, trait value, markers, chromosomes, and chromosome ranges. The results can be presented in columnar, Mega2, or PLINK format. Conclusions dbVOR serves our needs well. It is freely available from https://watson.hgen.pitt.edu/register.

abstract = {Cigarette smoking, high alcohol intake, and low dietary folate levels are risk factors for colorectal adenomas. Oxidative damage caused by these three factors can be repaired through the base excision repair pathway (BER). We hypothesized that genetic variation in BER might modify colorectal adenoma risk. In a sigmoidoscopy-based study, we examined associations between 182 haplotype tagging SNPs in 14 BER genes, and colorectal adenoma risk, and examined their potential role as modifiers of the effect cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and dietary folate levels. Among all individuals, no statistically significant associations between BER SNPs and adenoma risk persisted after correction for multiple comparisons. However, among Asian-Pacific Islanders we observed two SNPs in FEN1 and one in NTHL1, and among African-Americans one SNP in APEX1 that were associated with colorectal adenoma risk. Significant associations were also observed between SNPs in the NEIL2 gene and rectal adenoma risk. Three SNPS modified the effect of smoking (MUTYH interaction p = 0.002; OGG1 interaction p = 0.013); FEN1 interaction p = 0.013)), one SNP in LIG3 modified the effect of alcohol consumption (interaction p = 0.024) and two SNPs in LIG3 modified the effect of dietary folate (interaction p = 0.001 and p = 0.08) on colorectal adenoma risk. These findings support a role for genetic variants in the BER pathway as potential modifiers of colorectal adenoma risk. Our findings strengthen the role of oxidative damage induced by key lifestyle and dietary risk factors in colorectal adenoma formation.},

abstract = {Chronic inflammation is suggested to be associated with specific cancer sites, including breast cancer. Recent research has focused on the roles of genes involved in the leukotriene/lipoxygenase and prostaglandin/cyclooxygenase pathways in breast cancer etiology. We hypothesized that genes in ALOX/COX pathways and CRP polymorphisms would be associated with breast cancer risk and mortality in our sample of Hispanic/Native American (NA) (1430 cases, 1599 controls) and non-Hispanic white (NHW) (2093 cases, 2610 controls) women. A total of 104 Ancestral Informative Markers was used to distinguish European and NA ancestry. The adaptive rank truncated product (ARTP) method was used to determine the significance of associations for each gene and the inflammation pathway with breast cancer risk and by NA ancestry. Overall, the pathway was associated with breast cancer risk (PARTP = 0.01). Two-way interactions with NA ancestry (P(adj)  {\textless} 0.05) were observed for ALOX12 (rs2292350, rs2271316) and PTGS1 (rs10306194). We observed increases in breast cancer risk in stratified analyses by tertiles of polyunsaturated fat intake for ALOX12 polymorphisms; the largest increase in risk was among women in the highest tertile with ALOX12 rs9904779CC (Odds Ratio (OR), 1.49; 95{\%} Confidence Interval (CI) 1.14-1.94, P(adj) = 0.01). In a sub-analysis stratified by NSAIDs use, two-way interactions with NSAIDs use were found for ALOX12 rs9904779 (P(adj)  = 0.02), rs434473 (P(adj ) = 0.02), and rs1126667 (P(adj)  =  0.01); ORs for ALOX12 polymorphisms ranged from 1.55 to 1.64 among regular users. Associations were not observed with breast cancer mortality. These findings could support advances in the discovery of new pathways related to inflammation for breast cancer treatment.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Heritable factors contribute to the development of colorectal cancer. Identifying the genetic loci associated with colorectal tumor formation could elucidate the mechanisms of pathogenesis. Methods: We conducted a genome-wide association study that included 14 studies, 12,696 cases of colorectal tumors (11,870 cancer, 826 adenoma), and 15,113 controls of European descent. The 10 most statistically significant, previously unreported findings were followed up in 6 studies; these included 3056 colorectal tumor cases (2098 cancer, 958 adenoma) and 6658 controls of European and Asian descent. Results: Based on the combined analysis, we identified a locus that reached the conventional genome-wide significance level at less than 5.0 × 10-8: an intergenic region on chromosome 2q32.3, close to nucleic acid binding protein 1 (most significant single nucleotide polymorphism: rs11903757; odds ratio [OR], 1.15 per risk allele; P = 3.7 × 10-8). We also found evidence for 3 additional loci with P values less than 5.0 × 10-7: a locus within the laminin gamma 1 gene on chromosome 1q25.3 (rs10911251; OR, 1.10 per risk allele; P = 9.5 × 10-8), a locus within the cyclin D2 gene on chromosome 12p13.32 (rs3217810 per risk allele; OR, 0.84; P = 5.9 × 10-8), and a locus in the T-box 3 gene on chromosome 12q24.21 (rs59336; OR, 0.91 per risk allele; P = 3.7 × 10-7). Conclusions: In a large genome-wide association study, we associated polymorphisms close to nucleic acid binding protein 1 (which encodes a DNA-binding protein involved in DNA repair) with colorectal tumor risk. We also provided evidence for an association between colorectal tumor risk and polymorphisms in laminin gamma 1 (this is the second gene in the laminin family to be associated with colorectal cancers), cyclin D2 (which encodes for cyclin D2), and T-box 3 (which encodes a T-box transcription factor and is a target of Wnt signaling to $\beta$-catenin). The roles of these genes and their products in cancer pathogenesis warrant further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2013 AGA Institute.},

abstract = {Colorectal neoplasia is the third most common cancer worldwide. Environmental factors such as diet are known to be involved in the etiology of this cancer. Several epidemiological studies have suggested that specific neo-formed mutagenic compounds related to meat consumption are an underlying factor involved in the association between diet and colorectal cancer. Heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known mutagens and possible human carcinogens formed at the same time in meat during cooking processes. We studied the genotoxicity of the model PAH benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) and HCA 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), alone or in mixture, using the mouse intestinal cell line Apc(Min/+), mimicking the early step of colorectal carcinogenesis, and control Apc(+/+) cells. The genotoxicity of B(a)P and PhIP was investigated using both cell lines, through the quantification of B(a)P and PhIP derived DNA adducts, as well as the use of a genotoxic assay based on histone H2AX phosphorylation quantification. Our results demonstrate that heterozygous Apc mutated cells are more effective to metabolize B(a)P. We also established in different experiments that PhIP and B(a)P were more genotoxic on Apc (Min/+) cells compared to Apc (+/+) . Moreover when tested in mixture, we observed a combined genotoxicity of B(a)P and PhIP on the two cell lines, with an increase of PhIP derived DNA adducts in the presence of B(a)P. Because of their genotoxic effects observed on heterozygous Apc mutated cells and their possible combined genotoxic effects, both B(a)P and PhIP, taken together, could be implicated in the observed association between meat consumption and colorectal cancer.},

Research suggests that maintaining a healthy weight may reduce the risk for breast cancer after menopause. Additionally, alcohol increases the risk for breast cancer even at moderate levels of intake, and women who drink alcohol also should take sufficient folate, which can mitigate this excess risk. Interesting questions for future research include the role of soy products, red meat, energy balance, and vitamin D, with particular attention to timing of exposure in early life. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and dietary factors may differentially affect certain breast cancer subtypes; future studies should therefore attempt to characterize associations according to tumor characteristics.},

Therefore, using a subsample (n = 550) of women from a large cohort, we applied reduced rank regression to identify a dietary pattern that was correlated with estradiol and estrone sulfate. We then adapted the pattern to be used with the full cohort (n = 67,802) and prospectively assessed its association with postmenopausal breast cancer. The estrogen food pattern, characterized by higher intakes of red meat, legumes, and pizza, but lower intakes of coffee and whole grains, was modestly but significantly correlated with estradiol (r = 0.14) and estrone sulfate (r = 0.20). During 22 years of follow-up, we ascertained 4,596 incident breast cancer, with 2,938 estrogen receptor-positive tumors and 689 estrogen receptor-negative tumors. However, after adjusting for potential confounders, we did not observe any association with overall estrogen receptor-positive or estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. In conclusion, diet pattern appeared to only have modest association with estrogens, and was not associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Although these results were null, it should be repeated in other populations as differences in food intake may yield a dietary pattern with stronger association with estrogens.},

The objective of the present study was to test the relationship between the risk of prostate cancer and consumption of dairy products and Ca. The analysis included 2776 men from the French SU.VI.MAX (Supplementation en Vitamines et Min{\'{e}}raux Antioxydants) prospective study, among whom sixty-nine developed prostate cancer during the follow-up period (median: 7.7 years). Food consumption was assessed at inclusion from repeated 24 h records and nutrient intake was calculated using a food composition table. A higher risk of prostate cancer was observed among subjects with higher dairy product (relative risk (RR; 95 {\%} CI), 4th quartile v. 1st: 1.35 (1.02, 1.78), P = 0.04) and Ca intake (RR (95 {\%} CI), 4th quartile v. 1st: 2.43 (1.05, 5.62), P = 0.04). Nevertheless, we identified a harmful effect of yoghurt consumption upon the risk of prostate cancer (RR (95 {\%} CI), increment 125 g/d: 1.61 (1.07, 2.43), P = 0.02) independently of the Ca content. Our data support the hypothesis that dairy products have a harmful effect with respect to the risk of prostate cancer, largely related to Ca content. The higher risk of prostate cancer with linear increasing yoghurt consumption seems to be independent of Ca and may be related to some other component.},

An eight-item language-based acculturation measure was used to classify MA women. Multivariate logistic regression was used to test associations between language acculturation, country of residence, and reproductive and hormonal risk factors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: After adjustment for age and education, compared to women residing in Mexico, English-dominant MAs were significantly more likely to have an earlier age at menarche ({\textless}12 years; odds ratio [OR]=2.08; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.30-3.34), less likely to have a late age at first birth (≥30 years; OR=0.49; 95{\%} CI, 0.25-0.97), and less likely to ever breastfeed (OR=0.13; 95{\%} CI, 0.08-0.21).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Differences in reproductive and hormonal risk profile according to language acculturation and country of residence are evident; some of these were explained by education.

abstract = {Background. This paper presents data on breast cancer prevalence and mortality among US Hispanics and Hispanic subgroups, including Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Central American, and South American. Methods. Five-year average annual female breast cancer prevalence and mortality rates for 2009-2013 were examined using data from the National Health Interview Survey (prevalence) and the National Center for Health Statistics and the American Community Survey (mortality rates). Results. Overall breast cancer prevalence among US Hispanic women was 1.03{\%}. Although the estimates varied slightly by Hispanic subgroup, these differences were not statistically significant. The breast cancer mortality rate for Hispanics overall was 17.71 per 100,000 women. Higher rates were observed among Cubans (17.89), Mexicans (18.78), and Puerto Ricans (19.04), and a lower rate was observed among Central and South Americans (10.15). With the exception of the rate for Cubans, all Hispanic subgroup rates were statistically significantly different from the overall Hispanic rate. Additionally, all Hispanic subgroups rates were statistically significantly higher than the Central and South American rate. Conclusion. The data reveal significant differences in mortality across Hispanic subgroups. These data enable public health officials to develop targeted interventions to help lower breast cancer mortality among the highest risk populations.},

abstract = {The cooked meat carcinogen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) induces tumours of the breast, colon and prostate in rats. Here we show that in addition to its well-established genotoxicity, which can be detected at concentrations {\textgreater}10(-6) M, PhIP is also oestrogenic. In COS-1 cells transiently transfected with an oestrogen-responsive reporter gene, PhIP (10(-10)-10(-6) M) mediated transcription through oestrogen receptor (ER) alpha, but not ER-beta, and inhibition by the pure ER antagonist ICI 182 780 demonstrated a requirement for a functional ER. In contrast, the structurally related food-derived carcinogen 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) failed to induce reporter gene transcription. Additionally, we show that in a hormonally responsive breast cancer cell line (MCF-7 cells), PhIP induced transcriptional activation using endogenously expressed ER. Examination of the genotoxic potential of PhIP using a model mammalian cell mutation assay (hprt(-) locus) demonstrated that the genetic toxicology of PhIP was readily detectable, but separate, in terms of effective concentration, from its oestrogenic activity. To determine whether the oestrogenicity of PhIP could mediate oestrogen-dependent responses such as cell growth, we examined the growth of hormonally responsive cells (MCF-7 cells). We show that PhIP can stimulate cell proliferation and, again, this was dependent upon a functional ER. Using ligand blotting, we further show that PhIP can stimulate the expression of progesterone receptor (PR-A and PR-B) and c-MYC and activate the MAPK signal transduction pathway. These responses were similar to that produced by oestradiol, in terms of temporal aspects, potency and a requirement for a functional ER. Each of these dose-dependent mitogenic responses occurred at concentrations of PhIP ( approximately 10(-9)-10(-11)M) that are likely to be equivalent to systemic human exposure via consumption of cooked meat. Thus PhIP can induce cellular responses that encompass altered gene expression and mitogenesis. We suggest that the combination of genetic toxicology and oestrogen-like promotion of genomic and cellular events provide a mechanism for the tissue-specific tumorigenicity of this compound.},

abstract = {The medicinal use of aspirin stretches back to ancient times, before it was manufactured in its pure form in the late 19th century. Its accepted mechanistic target, cyclooxygenase (COX), was discovered in the 1970s and since this landmark discovery, the therapeutic application of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has increased dramatically. The most significant benefits of NSAIDs are in conditions involving chronic inflammation (CI). Given the recognized role of CI in cancer development, the use of long-term NSAID treatment in the prevention of cancer is an enticing possibility. COX-2 is a key driver of CI, and here we review COX-2 expression as a predictor of survival in various cancer types, including breast. Obesity and post-partum involution are natural inflammatory states that are associated with increased breast cancer risk. We outline the COX-2 mediated mechanisms contributing to the growth of cancers. We dissect the cellular mechanism of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and how COX-2 may induce this to facilitate tumor progression. Finally we examine the potential regulation of COX-2 by c-Myb, and the possible interplay between c-Myb/COX-2 in proliferation, and hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1$\alpha$)/COX-2 in invasive pathways in breast cancer.},

abstract = {Consumption of red meat, particularly well-done meat, has been associated with increased prostate cancer risk. High-temperature cooking methods such as grilling and barbecuing may produce heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are known carcinogens. We assessed the association with meat consumption and estimated HCA and PAH exposure in a population-based case-control study of prostate cancer. Newly diagnosed cases aged 40-79 years (531 advanced cases, 195 localized cases) and 527 controls were asked about dietary intake, including usual meat cooking methods and doneness levels. Odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using multivariate logistic regression. For advanced prostate cancer, but not localized disease, increased risks were associated with higher consumption of hamburgers (OR = 1.79, CI = 1.10-2.92), processed meat (OR = 1.57, CI = 1.04-2.36), grilled red meat (OR = 1.63, CI = 0.99-2.68), and well-done red meat (OR = 1.52, CI = 0.93-2.46), and intermediate intake of 2-amino-1-methyl1-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) (Quartile 2 vs. 1: OR = 1.41, CI = 0.98-2.01; Quartile 3 vs. 1: OR = 1.42, CI = 0.98-2.04), but not for higher intake. White meat consumption was not associated with prostate cancer. These findings provide further evidence that consumption of processed meat and red meat cooked at high temperature is associated with increased risk of advanced, but not localized, prostate cancer.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Association for Cancer Research. Background: Stomach cancer incidence shows substantial racial-ethnic disparity in the United States, with Korean Americans experiencing by far the highest incidence. We examined stomach cancer incidence trends in Korean Americans by tumor subsite, histology, and stage and compared them with incidence rates in racial-ethnic groups with the second highest rate (Japanese Americans) and the lowest rate (non-Hispanic whites; NHWs) as well as populations in South Korea and Japan. Methods: We calculated age-adjusted incidence rates by racialethnic groups, sex, and tumor characteristics, using the 1988-2012 California Cancer Registry data. Data on South Korea and Japan were obtained from the literature and other resources. Results: Between 1988 and 2012 in California, Korean Americans had about five times greater incidence thanNHWsand twice that of Japanese Americans. Tumor characteristics differed by ethnic group and gender. The incidence in Korean Americans has declined during recent years, for both cardia and noncardia sites and for both intestinal-and diffuse-type histology. Although Korean Americans were diagnosed at an earlier stage than other Californians, the proportion with localized disease (43{\%}) was much smaller than in South Korea (57{\%}), where populationbased screening is available. Conclusions: Stomach cancer incidence declined in the highest risk ethnic groups. However, the persistent disparity between Korean Americans and other racial-ethnic groups warrants additional strategies for prevention and earlier diagnosis. Impact: Analysis of California Cancer Registry data identified a racial-ethnic subgroup with stomach cancer disparity that may benefit from targeted prevention and screening efforts.},

Given the widespread use of PADT and the potential risks of serious adverse effects, accurate mortality data are needed to inform treatment decisions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using comprehensive utilization and cancer registry data from three integrated health plans. All men were newly diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer. Men who were diagnosed between 1995 and 2008, were not treated with curative intent therapy, and received follow-up through December 2010 were included in the study (n = 15,170). We examined all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality as our main outcomes. We used Cox proportional hazards models with and without propensity score analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Overall, PADT was associated with neither a risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95{\%} CI, 0.97 to 1.11) nor prostate-cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.03; 95{\%} CI, 0.89 to 1.19) after adjusting for all sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. PADT was associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality but not prostate-cancer-specific mortality. PADT was associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality only among the subgroup of men with a high risk of cancer progression (HR, 0.88; 95{\%} CI, 0.78 to 0.97).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We found no mortality benefit from PADT compared with no PADT for most men with clinically localized prostate cancer who did not receive curative intent therapy. Men with higher-risk disease may derive a small clinical benefit from PADT. Our study provides the best available contemporary evidence on the lack of survival benefit from PADT for most men with clinically localized prostate cancer.},

The LR test always achieved the most significant P-values, followed by the exact test. We further examined the results in a real data set composed of high- and low-cholesterol subjects from the Dallas Heart Study (DHS). We also compared the single-variant LR test with two multi-variant analysis approaches--the burden test and the C-alpha test--in analysing the sequencing data by simulation.

abstract = {Here we present a method of genome-wide inferred study (GWIS) that provides an approximation of genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for a variable that is a function of phenotypes for which GWAS summary statistics, phenotypic means, and covariances are available. A GWIS can be performed regardless of sample overlap between the GWAS of the phenotypes on which the function depends. Because a GWIS provides association estimates and their standard errors for each SNP, a GWIS can form the basis for polygenic risk scoring, LD score regression, Mendelian randomization studies, biological annotation, and other analyses. GWISs can also be used to boost power of a GWAS meta-analysis where cohorts have not measured all constituent phenotypes in the function. We demonstrate the accuracy of a BMI GWIS by performing power simulations and type I error simulations under varying circumstances, and we apply a GWIS by reconstructing a body mass index (BMI) GWAS based on a weight GWAS and a height GWAS. Furthermore, we apply a GWIS to further our understanding of the underlying genetic structure of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and their relation to educational attainment. Our analyses suggest that the previously reported genetic correlation between schizophrenia and educational attainment is probably induced by the observed genetic correlation between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and the previously reported genetic correlation between bipolar disorder and educational attainment.},

The aim was to examine if low-grade inflammation is related to post-menopausal breast cancer risk, and if obesity modifies this association. METHODS In the Malm{\"{o}} Diet and Cancer cohort, a nested case-control study was defined among 8,513 women free of cancer and aged 55-73 years at baseline (1991-96); 459 were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer during follow-up (until December 31st, 2010). In laboratory analyses of blood from 446 cases, and 885 controls (matched on age and date of blood sampling) we examined systemic inflammation markers: oxidized (ox)-LDL, interleukin (IL)-1$\beta$, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$, white blood cells, lymphocytes and neutrophils. Odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) for breast cancer risk was calculated using multivariable conditional logistic regression. RESULTS Inverse associations with breast cancer were seen in fully-adjusted models, for 2nd and 3rd tertiles of ox-LDL, OR (95{\%} CI): 0.65 (0.47-0.90), 0.63 (0.45-0.89) respectively, p-trend = 0.01; and for the 3rd tertile of TNF-$\alpha$, 0.65 (0.43-0.99), p-trend = 0.04. In contrast, those in the highest IL-1$\beta$ category had higher risk, 1.71 (1.05-2.79), p-trend = 0.01. Obesity did not modify associations between inflammation biomarkers and breast cancer. CONCLUSION Our study does not suggest that low-grade inflammation increase the risk of post-menopausal breast cancer.},

abstract = {Although debate on breast cancer and diet has been concentrated on nutrients, assessment of the role of specific foods and food groups and variety of food intake retains a considerable importance. To further elucidate the role of dietary habits, 2,569 women with incident breast cancer (median age 55 years) and 2,588 control women (median age 56 years), hospitalised with acute non-neoplastic diseases, were interviewed between 1991 and 1994 in 6 different Italian areas. The validated food frequency questionnaire included 79 food items and recipes, which were grouped into 18 food groups (5 for “diversity” analyses purpose). After allowance for non-dietary confounding factors and total energy intake, significant trends of increasing breast cancer risk with increasing intake emerged for the following food groups: bread and cereal dishes, pork and processed meats, and sugar and candies. Conversely, high intake of milk, poultry, fish, raw vegetables, potatoes and coffee and tea seemed to exert a protection against the development of breast cancer. Intake of soups, eggs, other meats, cheese, cooked vegetables, citrus fruits, other fruits and cake and desserts were not significantly related to breast cancer risk. The variety of vegetable types consumed weekly seemed to have a beneficial effect beyond the advantage of high vegetable intake per se. {\textcopyright} 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

BFDP shares the ease of calculation of the recently proposed false-positive report probability (FPRP) but uses more information, has a noteworthy threshold defined naturally in terms of the costs of false discovery and nondiscovery, and has a sound methodological foundation. In addition, in a multiple-testing situation, it is straightforward to estimate the expected numbers of false discoveries and false nondiscoveries. We provide an in-depth discussion of FPRP, including a comparison with the q value, and examine the empirical behavior of these measures, along with BFDP, via simulation. Finally, we use BFDP to assess the association between 131 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and lung cancer in a case-control study.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 14 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) that are associated with the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), and several of these tagSNPs are near bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway loci. The penalty of multiple testing implicit in GWAS increases the attraction of complementary approaches for disease gene discovery, including candidate gene- or pathway-based analyses. The strongest candidate loci for additional predisposition SNPs are arguably those already known both to have functional relevance and to be involved in disease risk. To investigate this proposition, we searched for novel CRC susceptibility variants close to the BMP pathway genes GREM1 (15q13.3), BMP4 (14q22.2), and BMP2 (20p12.3) using sample sets totalling 24,910 CRC cases and 26,275 controls. We identified new, independent CRC predisposition SNPs close to BMP4 (rs1957636, P = 3.93×10(-10)) and BMP2 (rs4813802, P = 4.65×10(-11)). Near GREM1, we found using fine-mapping that the previously-identified association between tagSNP rs4779584 and CRC actually resulted from two independent signals represented by rs16969681 (P = 5.33×10(-8)) and rs11632715 (P = 2.30×10(-10)). As low-penetrance predisposition variants become harder to identify-owing to small effect sizes and/or low risk allele frequencies-approaches based on informed candidate gene selection may become increasingly attractive. Our data emphasise that genetic fine-mapping studies can deconvolute associations that have arisen owing to independent correlation of a tagSNP with more than one functional SNP, thus explaining some of the apparently missing heritability of common diseases.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between dietary protein sources in early adulthood and risk of breast cancer. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Health professionals in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 88,803 premenopausal women from the Nurses' Health Study II who completed a questionnaire on diet in 1991. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident cases of invasive breast carcinoma, identified through self report and confirmed by pathology report. RESULTS: We documented 2830 cases of breast cancer during 20 years of follow-up. Higher intake of total red meat was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer overall (relative risk 1.22, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.06 to 1.40; P(trend) = 0.01, for highest fifth v lowest fifth of intake). However, higher intakes of poultry, fish, eggs, legumes, and nuts were not related to breast cancer overall. When the association was evaluated by menopausal status, higher intake of poultry was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women (0.73, 0.58 to 0.91; P(trend) =0.02, for highest fifth v lowest fifth of intake) but not in premenopausal women (0.93, 0.78 to 1.11; P(trend) = 0.60, for highest fifth v lowest fifth of intake). In estimating the effects of exchanging different protein sources, substituting one serving/day of legumes for one serving/day of red meat was associated with a 15{\%} lower risk of breast cancer among all women (0.85, 0.73 to 0.98) and a 19{\%} lower risk among premenopausal women (0.81, 0.66 to 0.99). Also, substituting one serving/day of poultry for one serving/day of red meat was associated with a 17{\%} lower risk of breast cancer overall (0.83, 0.72 to 0.96) and a 24{\%} lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (0.76, 0.59 to 0.99). Furthermore, substituting one serving/day of combined legumes, nuts, poultry, and fish for one serving/day of red meat was associated with a 14{\%} lower risk of breast cancer overall (0.86, 0.78 to 0.94) and premenopausal breast cancer (0.86, 0.76 to 0.98). CONCLUSION: Higher red meat intake in early adulthood may be a risk factor for breast cancer, and replacing red meat with a combination of legumes, poultry, nuts and fish may reduce the risk of breast cancer.},

abstract = {Diets high in red meat and processed meats are established colorectal cancer (CRC) risk factors. However, it is still not well understood what explains this association. We conducted comprehensive analyses of CRC risk and red meat and poultry intakes, taking into account cooking methods, level of doneness, estimated intakes of heterocyclic amines (HCAs) that accumulate during meat cooking, tumor location, and tumor mismatch repair proficiency (MMR) status. We analyzed food frequency and portion size data including a meat cooking module for 3364 CRC cases, 1806 unaffected siblings, 136 unaffected spouses, and 1620 unaffected population-based controls, recruited into the CRC Family Registry. Odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) for nutrient density variables were estimated using generalized estimating equations. We found no evidence of an association between total nonprocessed red meat or total processed meat and CRC risk. Our main finding was a positive association with CRC for pan-fried beefsteak (P(trend) {\textless} 0.001), which was stronger among MMR deficient cases (heterogeneity P = 0.059). Other worth noting associations, of borderline statistical significance after multiple testing correction, were a positive association between diets high in oven-broiled short ribs or spareribs and CRC risk (P(trend) = 0.002), which was also stronger among MMR-deficient cases, and an inverse association with grilled hamburgers (P(trend) = 0.002). Our results support the role of specific meat types and cooking practices as possible sources of human carcinogens relevant for CRC risk.},

abstract = {It was the aim of this study to examine the association of the consumption of meat in general, meat prepared by different cooking methods and the dietary intake of heterocyclic aromatic amines (HCA) with the level of DNA adducts in the breast tissue of women undergoing reduction mammoplasty. Dietary intake of meat and HCA were assessed via questionnaire in 44 women undergoing reduction mammoplasty. DNA adduct analysis in breast tissue was performed by (32)P-postlabelling analysis. Spearman rank correlation coefficients (r) were calculated to examine the association of meat consumption and dietary HCA intake with tissue DNA adduct levels. A median DNA adduct level of 18.45 (interquartile range 12.81-25.65) per 10(9) nucleotides in breast tissue was observed; median HCA intake was 40.43 ng/day (interquartile range 19.55-102.33 ng/day). Total HCA intake (r = 0.33, P = 0.03), consumption of fried meat (r = 0.39, P = 0.01), beef (r = 0.32, P = 0.03) and processed meat (r = 0.51, P = 0.0004) were statistically significantly correlated with the level of DNA adducts in breast tissue. The detected DNA adducts could not be confirmed to be specific HCA-derived DNA adducts by comparison with external standards, using the (32)P-postlabelling assay. We observed strong correlations of dietary HCA intake and consumption of fried and processed meat with DNA adduct levels in breast tissue of 44 women. Since the detected DNA adducts were not necessarily specific only for HCA, it is possible that HCA intake is a surrogate of other genotoxic substances, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in meat prepared at high temperatures.},

Data were analyzed using a combination of open-coding and content analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Fifty-three women participated in the study. For the majority of content areas, there were no major differences between the subethnicities. All women reported discussing cancer with a doctor after a family member had been diagnosed and discussing cancer within their families; however, the content of the discussion varied. Cuban and Puerto Rican women reported using the Internet routinely for health care information while Mexican women said they did not have access to computers and did not use them. All women liked the content and photos in the brochure but Mexican women thought the reading level was too high. Preferences for the spokesperson focused on the need for Spanish-speaking health care providers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: While the data show some similarities, such as patterns of cancer discussion and appreciation of the mock brochure, there were differences between the groups on information preferences.

abstract = {The number of publications performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has increased dramatically. Penalized regression approaches have been developed to overcome the challenges caused by the high dimensional data, but these methods are relatively new in the GWAS field. In this study we have compared the statistical performance of two methods (the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-lasso and the elastic net) on two simulated data sets and one real data set from a 50 K genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel of 5570 Fleckvieh bulls. The first simulated data set displays moderate to high linkage disequilibrium between SNPs, whereas the second simulated data set from the QTLMAS 2010 workshop is biologically more complex. We used cross-validation to find the optimal value of regularization parameter $\lambda$ with both minimum MSE and minimum MSE + 1SE of minimum MSE. The optimal $\lambda$ values were used for variable selection. Based on the first simulated data, we found that the minMSE in general picked up too many SNPs. At minMSE + 1SE, the lasso didn't acquire any false positives, but selected too few correct SNPs. The elastic net provided the best compromise between few false positives and many correct selections when the penalty weight $\alpha$ was around 0.1. However, in our simulation setting, this $\alpha$ value didn't result in the lowest minMSE + 1SE. The number of selected SNPs from the QTLMAS 2010 data was after correction for population structure 82 and 161 for the lasso and the elastic net, respectively. In the Fleckvieh data set after population structure correction lasso and the elastic net identified from 1291 to 1966 important SNPs for milk fat content, with major peaks on chromosomes 5, 14, 15, and 20. Hence, we can conclude that it is important to analyze GWAS data with both the lasso and the elastic net and an alternative tuning criterion to minimum MSE is needed for variable selection.},

abstract = {The mammalian family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) includes extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), with each MAPK signaling pathway consisting of at least three components, a MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K), a MAPK kinase (MAP2K), and a MAPK. The MAPK pathways are activated by diverse extracellular and intracellular stimuli including peptide growth factors, cytokines, hormones, and various cellular stressors such as oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress. These signaling pathways regulate a variety of cellular activities including proliferation, differentiation, survival, and death. Deviation from the strict control of MAPK signaling pathways has been implicated in the development of many human diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and various types of cancers. Persistent activation of the JNK or p38 signaling pathways has been suggested to mediate neuronal apoptosis in AD, PD, and ALS, whereas the ERK signaling pathway plays a key role in several steps of tumorigenesis including cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the roles of MAPK signaling pathways in human disorders, focusing on cancer and neurodegenerative diseases including AD, PD, and ALS. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Background: AWestern diet is associated with breast cancer risk. Objective:We investigated the relation of meat, egg, and dairy prod- uct consumption with breast cancer risk by using data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Design: Between 1992 and 2003, information on diet was collected from 319,826 women. Disease hazard ratios were estimated with multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Results: Breast cancer cases (n = 7119) were observed during 8.8 y (median) of follow-up. No consistent association was found be- tween breast cancer risk and the consumption of any of the food groups under study, when analyzed by both categorical and contin- uous exposure variable models. High processed meat consumption was associated with a modest increase in breast cancer risk in the categorical model (hazard ratio: 1.10; 95{\%} CI: 1.00, 1.20; highest compared with lowest quintile: P for trend = 0.07). Subgroup anal- yses suggested an association with butter consumption, limited to premenopausal women (hazard ratio: 1.28; 95{\%} CI: 1.06, 1.53; highest compared with lowest quintile: P for trend = 0.21). Be- tween-country heterogeneity was found for red meat (Q statistic = 18.03; P = 0.05) and was significantly explained (P = 0.023) by the proportion of meat cooked at high temperature. Conclusions: We have not consistently identified intakes of meat, eggs, or dairy products as risk factors for breast cancer. Future studies should investigate the possible role of high-temperature cooking in the relation of red meat intake with breast cancer risk.},

@article{Ferguson2004,
abstract = {Many of the cancers common in the Western world, including colon, prostate and breast cancers, are thought to relate to dietary habits. Of the known risk factors, many will act through increasing the probability of mutation. Recognised dietary mutagens include cooked meat compounds, N-nitroso compounds and fungal toxins, while high meat and saturated fat consumption, increasing rates of obesity, and regular consumption of alcohol and tobacco are all dietary trends that could indirectly enhance the probability of mutation. However, there are significant difficulties in implementing and sustaining major dietary changes necessary to reduce the population's intake of dietary mutagens. Dietary antimutagens may provide a means of slowing progression toward cancer, and be more acceptable to the population. Consideration of genetic mechanisms in cancer development suggest several distinct targets for intervention. Strategies that reduce mutagen uptake may be the most simple intervention, and the one least likely to result in undesirable side effects. Certain (but not all) types of dietary fibres appear to reduce mutation through this mechanism, as may certain probiotics and large planar molecules such as chlorophyllin. Antioxidants have been suggested to scavenge free radicals, and prevent their interactions with cellular DNA. Small molecule dietary antioxidants include ascorbic acid, Vitamin E, glutathione, various polyphenols and carotenoids. We found a statistically significant relationship between colon cancer incidence and soil selenium status across different regions of New Zealand. Additionally, a study of middle-aged men suggested that blood selenium levels lower than 100 ng/ml were inadequate for repair or surveillance of oxidative (and other) DNA damage. We suggest that selenium will be an important antimutagen, at least in New Zealand, possibly through antioxidant effects associated with selenium's role in enzymes associated with endogenous repair of DNA damage. Modulation of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes is well recognised as cancer-protective, and is a property of various flavonoids and a number of sulfur-containing compounds. Many fruits and vegetables contain compounds that will protect against mutation and cancer by several mechanisms. For example, kiwifruit has antioxidant effects and may also affect DNA repair enzymes. Dietary folate may be a key factor in maintenance of methylation status, while enhanced overall levels of vitamins and minerals may retard the development of genomic instability. The combination of each of these factors could provide a sustainable intervention that might usefully delay the development of cancer in New Zealand and other populations. Although there are a range of potentially antimutagenic fruits, vegetables and cereals available to these populations, current intake is generally below the level necessary to protect from dietary or endogenous mutagens. Dietary supplementation may provide an alternative approach. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Secondary outcomes based on cancer subtypes by sex, anatomic location, stage, and histology were also examined.Results There was little evidence that the multi-polymorphism score of 25(OH)D was associated with risk of any of the seven cancers or their subtypes. Specifically, the odds ratios per 25 nmol/L increase in genetically determined 25(OH)D concentrations were 0.92 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.76 to 1.10) for colorectal cancer, 1.05 (0.89 to 1.24) for breast cancer, 0.89 (0.77 to 1.02) for prostate cancer, and 1.03 (0.87 to 1.23) for lung cancer. The results were consistent with the two different analytical approaches, and the study was powered to detect relative effect sizes of moderate magnitude (for example, 1.20-1.50 per 25 nmol/L decrease in 25(OH)D for most primary cancer outcomes. The Mendelian randomisation assumptions did not seem to be violated.Conclusions There is little evidence for a linear causal association between circulating vitamin D concentration and risk of various types of cancer, though the existence of causal clinically relevant effects of low magnitude cannot be ruled out. These results, in combination with previous literature, provide evidence that population-wide screening for vitamin D deficiency and subsequent widespread vitamin D supplementation should not currently be recommended as a strategy for primary cancer prevention.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Common cancers develop through a multistep process often including inherited susceptibility. Collaboration among multiple institutions, and funding from multiple sources, has allowed the development of an inexpensive genotyping microarray, the OncoArray. The array includes a genome-wide backbone, comprising 230,000 SNPs tagging most common genetic variants, together with dense mapping of known susceptibility regions, rare variants from sequencing experiments, pharmacogenetic markers, and cancer-related traits. METHODS The OncoArray can be genotyped using a novel technology developed by Illumina to facilitate efficient genotyping. The consortium developed standard approaches for selecting SNPs for study, for quality control of markers, and for ancestry analysis. The array was genotyped at selected sites and with prespecified replicate samples to permit evaluation of genotyping accuracy among centers and by ethnic background. RESULTS The OncoArray consortium genotyped 447,705 samples. A total of 494,763 SNPs passed quality control steps with a sample success rate of 97{\%} of the samples. Participating sites performed ancestry analysis using a common set of markers and a scoring algorithm based on principal components analysis. CONCLUSIONS Results from these analyses will enable researchers to identify new susceptibility loci, perform fine-mapping of new or known loci associated with either single or multiple cancers, assess the degree of overlap in cancer causation and pleiotropic effects of loci that have been identified for disease-specific risk, and jointly model genetic, environmental, and lifestyle-related exposures.

abstract = {In the past decade active surveillance (AS) of men with localized prostate cancer has become an increasingly popular management option, and a range of clinical guidelines have been published on this topic. Existing guidelines regarding AS for prostate cancer vary widely, but predominantly state that the most suitable patients for AS are those with pretreatment clinical stage T1c or T2 tumours, serum PSA levels {\textless}10 ng/ml, biopsy Gleason scores of 6 or less, a maximum of one or two tumour-positive biopsy core samples and/or a maximum of 50{\%} of cancer per core sample. Following initiation of an AS programme, most guidelines recommend serial serum PSA measurements, digital rectal examinations and surveillance biopsies to check for and identify pathological indications of tumour progression. Definitions of disease reclassification and progression differ among guidelines and multiple criteria for initiation of definitive treatment are proposed. The variety of descriptions of criteria for clinically insignificant prostate cancer indicates a lack of consensus on optimal AS and intervention thresholds. A single set of guidelines are needed in order to reduce variations in clinical practice and to optimize clinical decision-making. To enable truly evidence-based guidelines, further research that combines existing evidence, while also gathering information from more long-term studies is needed.},

abstract = {Inflammation affects all stages of tumorigenesis. A key signaling pathway leading to acute and chronic inflammation is through activation of the caspase-1 inflammasome. Inflammasome complexes are assembled on activation of certain nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins (NLR), AIM2-like receptors, or pyrin. Of these, NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, NLRP6, and AIM2 influence the pathogenesis of cancer by modulating innate and adaptive immune responses, cell death, proliferation, and/or the gut microbiota. Activation of the inflammasome and IL18 signaling pathways is largely protective in colitis-associated colorectal cancer, whereas excessive inflammation driven by the inflammasome or the IL1 signaling pathways promotes breast cancer, fibrosarcoma, gastric carcinoma, and lung metastasis in a context-dependent manner. The clinical relevance of inflammasomes in multiple forms of cancer highlights their therapeutic promise as molecular targets. In this review, we explore the crossroads between inflammasomes and the development of various tumors and discuss possible therapeutic values in targeting the inflammasome for the prevention and treatment of cancer.

abstract = {Introduction IL-17A plays a key role in host defense against microbial infection including Gram-positive bacteria. Genetic factors contribute to the host defense. Whether genetic variation of IL-17A is associated with altered clinical outcome of severe sepsis is unknown. Methods We tested for genetic association of IL-17A SNPs with susceptibility to infection and clinical outcome of severe sepsis using two cohorts of European ancestry (St Paul's Hospital (SPH) derivation cohort, n = 679; Vasopressin and Septic Shock Trial (VASST) validation cohort n = 517). The primary outcome variable was susceptibility to Gram-positive bacterial infection. The secondary outcome variable was 28-day mortality. Results Of four tested tag SNPs (rs4711998, rs8193036, rs2275913, rs1974226) in the IL-17A gene, rs1974226 SNP was associated with altered susceptibility to Gram-positive bacterial infection in the derivation cohort (corrected P = 0.014). Patients who have the GG genotype of the rs1974226 SNP were more susceptible to Grampositive bacterial infection, compared to the AG/AA genotype in the two cohorts of severe sepsis (SPH, P = 0.0036; VASST, P = 0.011) and in the subgroup having lung infection (P = 0.017). Furthermore, the G allele of the IL-17A rs1974226 SNP was associated with increased 28- day mortality in two cohorts (SPH, adjusted OR 1.44, 95{\%} CI 1.04 to 2.02, P = 0.029; VASST, adjusted OR 1.67, 95{\%} CI 1.17 to 2.40, P = 0.0052). Conclusion IL-17A genetic variation is associated with altered susceptibility to Gram-positive infection and 28-day mortality of severe sepsis.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Research on the role of red meat and poultry consumption in breast carcinogenesis is inconclusive, but the evidence in African-American (AA) women is lacking. The association between consuming meat and breast cancer risk was examined in the Women's Circle of Health Study involving 803 AA cases, 889 AA controls, 755 Caucasian cases, and 701 Caucasian controls. METHODS: Dietary information was collected using a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 {\%} confidence intervals (CI) were obtained from logistic regression models adjusting for potential covariates. RESULTS: Comparing the fourth versus the first quartiles, among Caucasian women, processed meat (OR = 1.48; 95 {\%} CI 1.07-2.04), unprocessed red meat (OR = 1.40; 95 {\%} CI 1.01-1.94), and poultry intakes (OR = 1.42; 95 {\%} CI 1.01-1.99) increased breast cancer risk. Risk associated with poultry intake was more dominant in premenopausal women (OR = 2.33; 95 {\%} CI 1.44-3.77) and for women with ER- tumors (OR = 2.55; 95 {\%} CI 1.29-5.03) in the Caucasian group. Associations in AA women were mostly null except for a significant increased risk trend with processed meat consumption for ER+ tumors (OR = 1.36; 95 {\%} CI 0.94-1.97, p trend = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, associations between breast cancer risk and consumption of red meat and poultry were of different magnitude in AA and Caucasian women, with further differences noted by menopausal and hormone receptor status in Caucasian women. This is the first study to examine racial differences in meat and breast cancer risk and represents some of the first evidence in AA women.},

abstract = {Clinical studies often face the difficult problem of how to account for participants who die without experiencing the study outcome of interest. In a geriatric population with considerable comorbidities, the competing risk of death is especially high. Traditional approaches to describe risk of disease include Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression, but these methods can overestimate risk of disease by failing to account for the competing risk of death. This report discusses traditional survival analysis and competing risk analysis as used to estimate risk of disease in geriatric studies. Furthermore, it illustrates a competing risk approach to estimate risk of second hip fracture in the Framingham Osteoporosis Study and compares the results with traditional survival analysis. In this example, survival analysis overestimated the 5-year risk of second hip fracture by 37{\%} and the 10-year risk by 75{\%} compared with competing risk estimates. In studies of older individuals in which a substantial number of participants die during a long follow-up, the cumulative incidence competing risk estimate and competing risk regression should be used to determine incidence and effect estimates. Use of a competing risk approach is critical to accurately determining disease risk for elderly individuals and therefore best inform clinical decision-making.},

To identify new risk variants and to confirm reported associations, we conducted a genome-wide association study in 1,701 CRC cases and 14,082 cancer-free controls from the Finnish population. A total of 9,068,015 genetic variants were imputed and tested, and 30 promising variants were studied in additional 11,647 cases and 12,356 controls of European ancestry. The previously reported association between the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs992157 (2q35) and CRC was independently replicated (p = 2.08 × 10-4 ; OR, 1.14; 95{\%} CI, 1.06-1.23), and it was genome-wide significant in combined analysis (p = 1.50 × 10-9 ; OR, 1.12; 95{\%} CI, 1.08-1.16). Variants at 2q35, 6p21.2, 8q23.3, 8q24.21, 10q22.3, 10q24.2, 11q13.4, 11q23.1, 14q22.2, 15q13.3, 18q21.1, 20p12.3 and 20q13.33 were associated with CRC in the Finnish population (false discovery rate {\textless} 0.1), but new risk loci were not found. These results replicate the effects of multiple loci on the risk of CRC and identify shared risk alleles between the Finnish population isolate and outbred populations.},

abstract = {In the United States, asthma prevalence and mortality are the highest among Puerto Ricans and the lowest among Mexicans. Case-control association studies are a powerful strategy for identifying genes of modest effect in complex diseases. However, studies of complex disorders in admixed populations such as Latinos may be confounded by population stratification. We used ancestry informative markers (AIMs) to identify and correct for population stratification among Mexican and Puerto Rican subjects participating in case-control studies of asthma. Three hundred and sixty-two subjects with asthma (Mexican: 181, Puerto Rican: 181) and 359 ethnically matched controls (Mexican: 181, Puerto Rican: 178) were genotyped for 44 AIMs. We observed a greater than expected degree of association between pairs of AIMs on different chromosomes in Mexicans (P {\textless} 0.00001) and Puerto Ricans (P {\textless} 0.00002) providing evidence for population substructure and/or recent admixture. To assess the effect of population stratification on association studies of asthma, we measured differences in genetic background of cases and controls by comparing allele frequencies of the 44 AIMs. Among Puerto Ricans but not in Mexicans, we observed a significant overall difference in allele frequencies between cases and controls (P = 0.0002); of 44 AIMs tested, 8 (18{\%}) were significantly associated with asthma. However, after adjustment for individual ancestry, only two of these markers remained significantly associated with the disease. Our findings suggest that empirical assessment of the effects of stratification is critical to appropriately interpret the results of case-control studies in admixed populations.},

abstract = {The effect of meat consumption on cancer risk is a controversial issue. However, recent meta-analyses show that high consumers of cured meats and red meat are at increased risk of colorectal cancer. This increase is significant but modest (20-30{\%}). Current WCRF-AICR recommendations are to eat no more than 500. g per week of red meat, and to avoid processed meat. Moreover, our studies show that beef meat and cured pork meat promote colon carcinogenesis in rats. The major promoter in meat is heme iron, via N-nitrosation or fat peroxidation. Dietary additives can suppress the toxic effects of heme iron. For instance, promotion of colon carcinogenesis in rats by cooked, nitrite-treated and oxidized high-heme cured meat was suppressed by dietary calcium and by $\alpha$-tocopherol, and a study in volunteers supported these protective effects in humans. These additives, and others still under study, could provide an acceptable way to prevent colorectal cancer. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Emerging evidences suggest that chronic inflammation is one of the major causes of tumorigenesis. The role of inflammation in regulation of breast cancer progression is not well established. Recently Mediator of IRF3 Activation (MITA) protein has been identified that regulates NF-$\kappa$B and IFN pathways. Role of MITA in the context of inflammation and cancer progression has not been investigated. In the current report, we studied the role of MITA in the regulation of cross talk between cell death and inflammation in breast cancer cells. The expression of MITA was significantly lower on in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer cells than ER negative cells. Similarly, it was significantly down regulated in tumor tissue as compared to the normal tissue. The overexpression of MITA in MCF-7 and T47D decreases the cell proliferation and increases the cell death by activation of caspases. MITA positively regulates NF-$\kappa$B transcription factor, which is essential for MITA induced cell death. The activation of NF-$\kappa$B induces TNF-$\alpha$ production which further sensitizes MITA induced cell death by activation of death receptor pathway through capsase-8. MITA expression decreases the colony forming units and migration ability of MCF-7 cells. Thus, our finding suggests that MITA acts as a tumor suppressor which is down regulated during tumorigenesis providing survival advantage to tumor cell. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {To understand the genetic drivers of immune recognition and evasion in colorectal cancer (CRC), we analyzed 1,211 CRC primary tumor samples, including 179 classified as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-high). This set includes The Cancer Genome Atlas CRC cohort of 592 samples, completed and analyzed here. MSI-high, a hypermutated, immunogenic subtype of CRC, had a high rate of significantly mutated genes in important immune modulating pathways and in the antigen presentation machinery, including biallelic losses of B2M and HLA genes due to copy number alterations and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH). WNT/$\beta$-catenin signaling genes were significantly mutated in all CRC subtypes, and activated WNT/$\beta$-catenin signaling was correlated with the absence of T-cell infiltration. This large-scale genomic analysis of CRC demonstrates that MSI-high cases frequently undergo an immunoediting process that provides them with genetic events allowing immune escape despite high mutational load and frequent lymphocytic infiltration, and furthermore, that CRC tumors have genetic and methylation events associated with activated WNT signaling and T-cell exclusion.},

Dysregulation of cytokine signaling can cause a variety of diseases, including allergy, autoimmune diseases, inflammation, and cancer. Most cytokines use the so-called janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway, and this pathway is negatively regulated by suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins. SOCS proteins bind to janus kinase and to certain cytokine receptors and signaling molecules, thereby suppressing further signaling events. Studies have shown that SOCS proteins are key physiological regulators of inflammation. Recent studies have also demonstrated that SOCS1 and SOCS3 are important regulators of adaptive immunity.},

abstract = {In epidemiologic studies, total energy intake is often related to disease risk because of associations between physical activity or body size and the probability of disease. In theory, differences in disease incidence may also be related to metabolic efficiency and therefore to total energy intake. Because intakes of most specific nutrients, particularly macronutrients, are correlated with total energy intake, they may be noncausally associated with disease as a result of confounding by total energy intake. In addition, extraneous variation in nutrient intake resulting from variation in total energy intake that is unrelated to disease risk may weaken associations. Furthermore, individuals or populations must alter their intake of specific nutrients primarily by altering the composition of their diets rather than by changing their total energy intake, unless physical activity or body weight are changed substantially. Thus, adjustment for total energy intake is usually appropriate in epidemiologic studies to control for confounding, reduce extraneous variation, and predict the effect of dietary interventions. Failure to account for total energy intake can obscure associations between nutrient intakes and disease risk or even reverse the direction of association. Several disease-risk models and formulations of these models are available to account for energy intake in epidemiologic analyses, including adjustment of nutrient intakes for total energy intake by regression analysis and addition of total energy to a model with the nutrient density (nutrient divided by energy).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Adolescence may be a period of increased susceptibility to breast cancer due to regular division of undifferentiated cells that occurs between puberty and first birth. Red meat consumption during early adult life has been associated with breast cancer, but intake during adolescence has not been examined prospectively. We aimed to assess the relationship between red meat intake during adolescence and premenopausal breast cancer. METHODS We examined the incidence of invasive premenopausal breast cancer prospectively within the Nurses' Health Study II. A total of 39,268 premenopausal women who completed a validated 124-item food frequency questionnaire on their diet during high school, were followed for 7 years, from 1998 to 2005. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI). RESULTS 455 cases of invasive premenopausal breast cancer were diagnosed between 1998 and 2005. Compared with women in the lowest quintile of red meat intake during high school, the multivariate-adjusted RR for the highest quintile of intake was 1.34 (95{\%} CI, 0.94-1.89; P(trend) = 0.05). A significant linear association was observed with every additional 100 g of red meat consumed per day (RR, 1.20; 95{\%} CI, 1.00-1.43; P = 0.05). This association was more pronounced in hormone receptor-positive tumors (RR, 1.36; 95{\%} CI, 1.08-1.70; P = 0.008) and was not significant in hormone receptor-negative tumors (RR, 0.99; 95{\%} CI, 0.61-1.61, P = 0.97). CONCLUSION Higher red meat intake in adolescence may increase the risk of premenopausal breast cancer.},

abstract = {Patients with cancer have circulating heterophile antibodies that agglutinate animal red cells via recognition of the mammalian cell surface sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), which was long considered an oncofetal antigen in humans. However, humans are genetically deficient in Neu5Gc production and instead metabolically accumulate Neu5Gc from dietary sources, particularly red meats and milk products. Moreover, mice with a human-like defect showed no alternate pathway for Neu5Gc synthesis and even normal humans express anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. We show here that human tumors accumulate Neu5Gc that is covalently attached to multiple classes of glycans. The paradox of human tumor Neu5Gc accumulation in the face of circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies was hypothesized to be due to facilitation of tumor progression by the resulting low-grade chronic inflammation. Indeed, murine tumors expressing human-like levels of Neu5Gc show accelerated growth in syngeneic mice with a human-like Neu5Gc deficiency, coincident with the induction of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies and increased infiltration of inflammatory cells. Transfer of polyclonal monospecific syngeneic mouse anti-Neu5Gc serum also enhanced growth of transplanted syngeneic tumors bearing human-like levels of Neu5Gc, with tumors showing evidence for antibody deposition, enhanced angiogenesis and chronic inflammation. These effects were suppressed by a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, a drug type known to reduce human carcinoma risk. Finally, affinity-purified human anti-Neu5Gc antibodies also accelerate growth of Neu5Gc-containing tumors in Neu5Gc-deficient mice. Taken together, the data suggest that the human propensity to develop diet-related carcinomas is contributed to by local chronic inflammation, resulting from interaction of metabolically-accumulated dietary Neu5Gc with circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies.},

abstract = {Obesity and its comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, are associated with a state of chronic low-grade inflammation that can be detected both systemically and within specific tissues. Areas of active investigation focus on the molecular bases of metabolic inflammation and potential pathogenic roles in insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. An increased accumulation of macrophages occurring in obese adipose tissue has emerged as a key process in metabolic inflammation. Recent studies have also begun to unravel the heterogeneity of adipose tissue macrophages, and their physical and functional interactions with adipocytes, endothelial cells, and other immune cells within the adipose tissue microenvironment. Translating the information gathered from experimental models of insulin resistance and diabetes into meaningful therapeutic interventions is a tantalizing goal with long-term global health implications. In this context, ongoing clinical studies are testing the effects of targeting inflammation systemically on metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes.},

abstract = {Context Minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (MIRP) has diffused rapidly despite limited data on outcomes and greater costs compared with open retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP). Objective To determine the comparative effectiveness of MIRP vs RRP. Design, Setting, and Patients Population-based observational cohort study using US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare linked data from 2003 through 2007. We identified men with prostate cancer who underwent MIRP (n = 1938) vs RRP (n = 6899). Main Outcome Measures We compared postoperative 30-day complications, anastomotic stricture 31 to 365 days postoperatively, long-term incontinence and erectile dysfunction more than 18 months postoperatively, and postoperative use of additional cancer therapies, a surrogate for cancer control. Results Among men undergoing prostatectomy, use of MIRP increased from 9.2{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 8.1{\%}-10.5{\%}) in 2003 to 43.2{\%} (95{\%} CI, 39.6{\%}-46.9{\%}) in 2006-2007. Men undergoing MIRP vs RRP were more likely to be recorded as Asian (6.1{\%} vs 3.2{\%}), less likely to be recorded as black (6.2{\%} vs 7.8{\%}) or Hispanic (5.6{\%} vs 7.9{\%}), and more likely to live in areas with at least 90{\%} high school graduation rates (50.2{\%} vs 41.0{\%}) and with median incomes of at least {\$}60 000 (35.8{\%} vs 21.5{\%}) (all P {\textless} .001). In propensity score–adjusted analyses, MIRP vs RRP was associated with shorter length of stay (median, 2.0 vs 3.0 days; P{\textless}.001) and lower rates of blood transfusions (2.7{\%} vs 20.8{\%}; P {\textless} .001), postoperative respiratory complications (4.3{\%} vs 6.6{\%}; P = .004), miscellaneous surgical complications (4.3{\%} vs 5.6{\%}; P = .03), and anastomotic stricture (5.8{\%} vs 14.0{\%}; P {\textless} .001). However, MIRP vs RRP was associated with an increased risk of genitourinary complications (4.7{\%} vs 2.1{\%}; P = .001) and diagnoses of incontinence (15.9 vs 12.2 per 100 person-years; P = .02) and erectile dysfunction (26.8 vs 19.2 per 100 person-years; P = .009). Rates of use of additional cancer therapies did not differ by surgical procedure (8.2 vs 6.9 per 100 person-years; P = .35). Conclusion Men undergoing MIRP vs RRP experienced shorter length of stay, fewer respiratory and miscellaneous surgical complications and strictures, and similar postoperative use of additional cancer therapies but experienced more genitourinary complications, incontinence, and erectile dysfunction.},

abstract = {Over the last 20 years it has become clear that colorectal cancer (CRC) evolves through multiple pathways. These pathways may be defined on the basis of two molecular features: (i) DNA microsatellite instability (MSI) status stratified as MSI-high (MSI-H), MSI-low (MSI-L) and MS stable (MSS), and (ii) CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) stratified as CIMP-high, CIMP-low and CIMP-negative (CIMP-neg). In this review the morphological correlates of five molecular subtypes are outlined: Type 1 (CIMP-high/MSI-H/BRAF mutation), Type 2 (CIMP-high/MSI-L or MSS/BRAF mutation), Type 3 (CIMP-low/MSS or MSI-L/KRAS mutation), Type 4 (CIMP-neg/MSS) and Type 5 or Lynch syndrome (CIMP-neg/MSI-H). The molecular pathways are determined at an early evolutionary stage and are fully established within precancerous lesions. Serrated polyps are the precursors of Types 1 and 2 CRC, whereas Types 4 and 5 evolve through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Type 3 CRC may arise within either type of polyp. Types 1 and 4 are conceived as having few, if any, molecular overlaps with each other, whereas Types 2, 3 and 5 combine the molecular features of Types 1 and 4 in different ways. This approach to the classification of CRC should accelerate understanding of causation and will impact on clinical management in the areas of both prevention and treatment.},

In mammals, PDEs are divided into 11 families, of which PDE4 represents the largest family. Four genes (pde4a, pde4b, pde4c and pde4d) encode for this class of enzymes in mammals and give rise to more than 20 variants. Within this family of genes, PDE4D was discovered on the basis of its regulatory properties and its induction by hormones and cAMP. PDE4D has often been used as the prototype PDE4 and large body of work has been generated on the biochemical, pharmacological, and physiological properties of this enzyme. This review covers the regulation of PDE4D by phosphorylation, the impact of this regulation in the context of the structure of this protein, and the functional consequences of this complex pattern of posttranslational modifications.},

However, for Hispanics, completeness and accuracy of registry birthplace is unknown. By comparing registry birthplace to self-reported birthplace from 13 interview studies, we determined the completeness and accuracy of this variable and the associations of these measures with patient and hospital characteristics in the Greater Bay Area. Registry birthplace was unrecorded for 46{\%} of 1277 Hispanic cancer cases, and unrecorded birthplace (i.e., incompleteness) was associated with younger age, higher education, English language preference, US birthplace, and admission at certain hospitals. For 691 Hispanics with available registry birthplace, sensitivity and positive predictive value compared to self-report (i.e., accuracy) were 96.3 and 97.3 among foreign-born, and 96.8 and 95.6 among US-born. US-born Hispanics misclassified in the registry as foreign-born were more likely to have unavailable education information, be deceased, prefer a language besides English, and be diagnosed at a smaller hospital or before 1996. Among self-reported foreign-born Hispanics, those misclassified as US-born were less likely to have been diagnosed at an HMO. Although the completeness and accuracy of birthplace information may vary across registries, this variable appears to be limited for analyses involving Hispanics.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many genetic susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, variants in these loci explain only a small proportion of familial aggregation, and there are likely additional variants that are associated with CRC susceptibility. Genome-wide studies of gene-environment interactions may identify variants that are not detected in GWAS of marginal gene effects. To study this, we conducted a genome-wide analysis for interaction between genetic variants and alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking using data from the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR) and the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO). Interactions were tested using logistic regression. We identified interaction between CRC risk and alcohol consumption and variants in the 9q22.32/HIATL1 (Pinteraction = 1.76×10-8; permuted p-value 3.51x10-8) region. Compared to non-/occasional drinking light to moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer among individuals with rs9409565 CT genotype (OR, 0.82 [95{\%} CI, 0.74-0.91]; P = 2.1×10-4) and TT genotypes (OR,0.62 [95{\%} CI, 0.51-0.75]; P = 1.3×10-6) but not associated among those with the CC genotype (p = 0.059). No genome-wide statistically significant interactions were observed for smoking. If replicated our suggestive finding of a genome-wide significant interaction between genetic variants and alcohol consumption might contribute to understanding colorectal cancer etiology and identifying subpopulations with differential susceptibility to the effect of alcohol on CRC risk.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in developed countries. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified novel susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer. To follow up on these findings, and try to identify novel colorectal cancer susceptibility loci, we present results for GWAS of colorectal cancer (2,906 cases, 3,416 controls) that have not previously published main associations. Specifically, we calculated odds ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals using log-additive models for each study. In order to improve our power to detect novel colorectal cancer susceptibility loci, we performed a meta-analysis combining the results across studies. We selected the most statistically significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for replication using ten independent studies (8,161 cases and 9,101 controls). We again used a meta-analysis to summarize results for the replication studies alone, and for a combined analysis of GWAS and replication studies. We measured ten SNPs previously identified in colorectal cancer susceptibility loci and found eight to be associated with colorectal cancer (p value range 0.02 to 1.8 × 10(-8)). When we excluded studies that have previously published on these SNPs, five SNPs remained significant at p {\textless} 0.05 in the combined analysis. No novel susceptibility loci were significant in the replication study after adjustment for multiple testing, and none reached genome-wide significance from a combined analysis of GWAS and replication. We observed marginally significant evidence for a second independent SNP in the BMP2 region at chromosomal location 20p12 (rs4813802; replication p value 0.03; combined p value 7.3 × 10(-5)). In a region on 5p33.15, which includes the coding regions of the TERT-CLPTM1L genes and has been identified in GWAS to be associated with susceptibility to at least seven other cancers, we observed a marginally significant association with rs2853668 (replication p value 0.03; combined p value 1.9 × 10(-4)). Our study suggests a complex nature of the contribution of common genetic variants to risk for colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {Hispanic women in the USA have lower breast cancer incidence than non-Hispanic white (NHW) women. Genetic factors may contribute to this difference. Breast cancer genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted in women of European or Asian descent have identified multiple risk variants. We tested the association between 10 previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and risk of breast cancer in a sample of 4697 Hispanic and 3077 NHW women recruited as part of three population-based case-control studies of breast cancer. We used stratified logistic regression analyses to compare the associations with different genetic variants in NHWs and Hispanics classified by their proportion of Indigenous American (IA) ancestry. Five of 10 SNPs were statistically significantly associated with breast cancer risk. Three of the five significant variants (rs17157903-RELN, rs7696175-TLR1 and rs13387042-2q35) were associated with risk among Hispanics but not in NHWs. The odds ratio (OR) for the heterozygous at 2q35 was 0.75 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.50-1.15] for low IA ancestry and 1.38 (95{\%} CI = 1.04-1.82) for high IA ancestry (P interaction 0.02). The ORs for association at RELN were 0.87 (95{\%} CI = 0.59-1.29) and 1.69 (95{\%} CI = 1.04-2.73), respectively (P interaction 0.03). At the TLR1 locus, the ORs for women homozygous for the rare allele were 0.74 (95{\%} CI = 0.42-1.31) and 1.73 (95{\%} CI = 1.19-2.52) (P interaction 0.03). Our results suggest that the proportion of IA ancestry modifies the magnitude and direction of the association of 3 of the 10 previously reported variants. Genetic ancestry should be considered when assessing risk in women of mixed descent and in studies designed to discover causal mutations.},

abstract = {Background: Liver kinase 1 (LKB1) is emerging as a multifunctional protein, acting as a key metabolic enzyme, regulator of cell polarity, and transcription factor. Altered LKB1 expression has been linked with various cancers and may be a potential prognostic marker. While the functional role of LKB1 continues to undergo intensive investigation, the molecular mechanisms that regulate its expression remain to be defined more clearly. Recent reports have established a possible link between estrogen receptor alpha (ER$\alpha$) signaling and LKB1 in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The current study aimed to investigate whether LKB1 is transcriptionally regulated by ER$\alpha$ in MCF-7 cells. Methods: siRNA transfections were used to transiently knock down LKB1 and ER$\alpha$ LKB1 and ER$\alpha$ mRNA and protein levels were evaluated by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. An approximately 3 kilobase pair human LKB1 promoter construct and various truncations were generated, transfected into MCF-7 cells, and luciferase reporter assays were performed. Cells were also treated with various doses of 17-$\beta$-estradiol (E2) to evaluate the effect on LKB1 and ER$\alpha$ mRNA levels. Results: LKB1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly lower in ER$\alpha$-positive MCF-7 compared to ER$\alpha$-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, suggesting that ER$\alpha$ may act as a repressor. siRNA-mediated knock-down of ER$\alpha$ in MCF-7 cells significantly increased LKB1 promoter activity and expression at the mRNA and protein levels, and computational analysis revealed the presence of several putative estrogen response element (ERE) DNA binding sites in the LKB1 promoter region. In addition, treatment with E2 led to an increase in LKB1 expression, concomitant with decreased expression of ER$\alpha$ in MCF-7 cells. The E2-mediated increase was abrogated by pretreatment with actinomycin D, supporting that the observed changes in LKB1 levels were transcriptionally regulated. Conclusions: ER$\alpha$ repressively modulates the expression of LKB1 at the transcriptional level. Targeting the expression of LKB1 by modulating ER$\alpha$ signaling may provide a potential approach to further evaluate its function in ER$\alpha$-positive breast cancers. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Finding individual-level data for adequately-powered Mendelian randomization analyses may be problematic. As publicly-available summarized data on genetic associations with disease outcomes from large consortia are becoming more abundant, use of published data is an attractive analysis strategy for obtaining precise estimates of the causal effects of risk factors on outcomes. We detail the necessary steps for conducting Mendelian randomization investigations using published data, and present novel statistical methods for combining data on the associations of multiple (correlated or uncorrelated) genetic variants with the risk factor and outcome into a single causal effect estimate. A two-sample analysis strategy may be employed, in which evidence on the gene-risk factor and gene-outcome associations are taken from different data sources. These approaches allow the efficient identification of risk factors that are suitable targets for clinical intervention from published data, although the ability to assess the assumptions necessary for causal inference is diminished. Methods and guidance are illustrated using the example of the causal effect of serum calcium levels on fasting glucose concentrations. The estimated causal effect of a 1 standard deviation (0.13 mmol/L) increase in calcium levels on fasting glucose (mM) using a single lead variant from the CASR gene region is 0.044 (95 {\%} credible interval -0.002, 0.100). In contrast, using our method to account for the correlation between variants, the corresponding estimate using 17 genetic variants is 0.022 (95 {\%} credible interval 0.009, 0.035), a more clearly positive causal effect.},

abstract = {Although the relation between red and processed meat intake and colorectal cancer has been reported in several epidemiologic studies, very few investigated the potential mechanisms. This study examined multiple potential mechanisms in a large U.S. prospective cohort with a detailed questionnaire on meat type and meat cooking methods linked to databases for estimating intake of mutagens formed in meats cooked at high temperatures (heterocyclic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), heme iron, nitrate, and nitrite. During 7 years of follow-up, 2,719 colorectal cancer cases were ascertained from a cohort of 300,948 men and women. The hazard ratios (HR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI) comparing the fifth to the first quintile for both red (HR, 1.24; 95{\%} CI, 1.09-1.42; P(trend) {\textless} 0.001) and processed meat (HR, 1.16; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-1.32; P(trend) = 0.017) intakes indicated an elevated risk for colorectal cancer. The potential mechanisms for this relation include heme iron (HR, 1.13; 95{\%} CI, 0.99-1.29; P(trend) = 0.022), nitrate from processed meats (HR, 1.16; 95{\%} CI, 1.02-1.32; P(trend) = 0.001), and heterocyclic amine intake [HR, 1.19; 95{\%} CI, 1.05-1.34; P(trend) {\textless} 0.001 for 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and HR, 1.17; 95{\%} CI, 1.05-1.29; P(trend) {\textless}0.001 for 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx)]. In general, the elevated risks were higher for rectal cancer than for colon cancer, with the exception of MeIQx and DiMeIQx, which were only associated with colon cancer. In conclusion, we found a positive association for red and processed meat intake and colorectal cancer; heme iron, nitrate/nitrite, and heterocyclic amines from meat may explain these associations.},

abstract = {The understanding of mutagenic potency has been primarily approached using "quantitative structure-activity relationships" (QSAR). Often this method allows the prediction of mutagenic potency of the compound based on its structure. But it does not give the underlying reason why the mutagenic activities differ. We have taken a set of heterocyclic amine structures and used molecular dynamic calculations to dock these molecules into the active site of a computational model of the cytochrome P4501A2 enzyme. The calculated binding strength using Boltzman distribution constants was then compared to the QSAR value (HF/6-31G* optimized structures) and the Ames/Salmonella mutagenic potency. Further understanding will only come from knowing the complete set of mutagenic determinants. These include the nitrenium ion half-life, DNA adduct half-life, efficiency of repair of the adduct, and ultimately fixation of the mutation through cellular processes. For two isomers, PhIP and 3-Me-PhIP, we showed that for the 100-fold difference in the mutagenic potency a 5-fold difference can be accounted for by differences in the P450 oxidation. The other factor of 20 is not clearly understood but is downstream from the oxidation step. The application of QSAR (chemical characteristics) to biological principles related to mutagenesis is explored in this report. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A genome-wide association (GWA) study of asthma with 359 cases from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) and 846 genetically matched controls from the Illumina ICONdb public resource was performed. The strongest region of association seen was on chromosome 5q12 in PDE4D. The phosphodiesterase 4D, cAMP-specific (phosphodiesterase E3 dunce homolog, Drosophila) gene (PDE4D) is a regulator of airway smooth-muscle contractility, and PDE4 inhibitors have been developed as medications for asthma. Allelic p values for top SNPs in this region were 4.3 × 10-07 for rs1588265 and 9.7 × 10-07 for rs1544791. Replications were investigated in ten independent populations with different ethnicities, study designs, and definitions of asthma. In seven white and Hispanic replication populations, two PDE4D SNPs had significant results with p values less than 0.05, and five had results in the same direction as the original population but had p values greater than 0.05. Combined p values for 18,891 white and Hispanic individuals (4,342 cases) in our replication populations were 4.1 × 10-04 for rs1588265 and 9.2 × 10-04 for rs1544791. In three black replication populations, which had different linkage disequilibrium patterns than the other populations, original findings were not replicated. Further study of PDE4D variants might lead to improved understanding of the role of PDE4D in asthma pathophysiology and the efficacy of PDE4 inhibitor medications. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims Risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) can be greatly reduced through screening. To aid in the development of screening strategies, we refined models designed to determine risk of CRC by incorporating information from common genetic susceptibility loci. Methods By using data collected from more than 12,000 participants in 6 studies performed from 1990 through 2011 in the United States and Germany, we developed risk determination models based on sex, age, family history, genetic risk score (number of risk alleles carried at 27 validated common CRC susceptibility loci), and history of endoscopic examinations. The model was validated using data collected from approximately 1800 participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, conducted from 1993 through 2001 in the United States. Results We identified a CRC genetic risk score that independently predicted which patients in the training set would develop CRC. Compared with determination of risk based only on family history, adding the genetic risk score increased the discriminatory accuracy from 0.51 to 0.59 (P =.0028) for men and from 0.52 to 0.56 (P =.14) for women. We calculated age- and sex-specific 10-year CRC absolute risk estimates based on the number of risk alleles, family history, and history of endoscopic examinations. A model that included a genetic risk score better determined the recommended starting age for screening in subjects with and without family histories of CRC. The starting age for high-risk men (family history of CRC and genetic risk score, 90{\%}) was 42 years, and for low-risk men (no family history of CRC and genetic risk score, 10{\%}) was 52 years. For men with no family history and a high genetic risk score (90{\%}), the starting age would be 47 years; this is an intermediate value that is 5 years earlier than it would be for men with a genetic risk score of 10{\%}. Similar trends were observed in women. Conclusions By incorporating information on CRC risk alleles, we created a model to determine the risk for CRC more accurately. This model might be used to develop screening and prevention strategies.},

We prospectively examined the association of dairy product and calcium intake with prostate cancer risk in 29,509 men, including 1,910 cases, in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. We also evaluated the relation of calcium intake with serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] and 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], in a Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Trial substudy (n = 275). Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Baseline serum 1,25(OH)2D was determined by RIA. Greater intake of dairy products, particularly low-fat dairy products, was weakly associated with increased risk of prostate cancer [relative risk (RR), 1.12; 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI), 0.97-1.30; P trend = 0.06 for {\textgreater}2.75 versus [{\&}le;]0.98 servings of total dairy/day; 1.23 (1.07-1.41) for low-fat dairy].

Associations of dairy product and dietary calcium intake were evident for nonaggressive disease (RR, 1.20; 95{\%} CI, 0.99-1.46; P trend = 0.01 for dairy products; 1.64, 1.04-2.57; P trend = 0.002 for dietary calcium), but not aggressive disease (RR, 1.02; 95{\%} CI, 0.81-1.28 for dairy products; 0.94, 0.49-1.80 for dietary calcium). Calcium intake was not associated with serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D and 1,25(OH)2D concentration. In this large prospective study in a prostate cancer screening trial, greater dietary intake of calcium and dairy products, particularly low-fat types, may be modestly associated with increased risks for nonaggressive prostate cancer, but was unrelated to aggressive disease. Furthermore, we found no relationship between calcium intake and circulating vitamin D. (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2007;16(12):2623-30)},

abstract = {In recent years, and based on the importance of fish as a part of a healthy diet, there has been a notable promotion of fish consumption. However, the balance between health benefits and risks, due to the intake of chemical contaminants, is not well characterized. In the present study, edible samples of 14 marine species were analyzed for the concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids, as well as a number of metals and organic pollutants. Daily intakes were specifically determined for a standard adult of 70 kg, and compared with the tolerable/admissible intakes of the pollutants, if available. Salmon, mackerel, and red mullet were the species showing the highest content of omega-3 fatty acids. The daily intakes of cadmium, lead, and mercury through fish consumption were 1.1, 2.0, and 9.9 $\mu$g, respectively. Dioxins and furans plus dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) intake was 38.0 pg WHO-TEQ/day, whereas those of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated diphenyl ethers (PCDEs), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were 20.8, 39.4, 1.53, and 1.50 ng/day, respectively. In turn, the total intake of 16 analyzed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was 268 ng/day. The monthly fish consumption limits for human health endpoints based on the intake of these chemical contaminants were calculated for a 70 years exposure. In general terms, most marine species here analyzed should not mean adverse health effects for the consumers. However, the type of fish, the frequency of consumption, and the meal size are essential issues for the balance of the health benefits and risks of regular fish consumption. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data and statistics on cancer mortality over the last decades are available for most developed countries, while they are more difficult to obtain, in a standardized and comparable format, for countries of Latin America. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Age standardized (world population) mortality rates around the year 2000, derived from the WHO database, are presented for 14 selected cancers and total cancer in 10 countries of Latin America, plus, for comparative purposes, Canada and the USA. Trends in mortality are also given over the period 1970-2000. RESULTS: In 2000, the highest total cancer mortality for males was observed in Argentina and Chile, with rates comparable to those of Canada and the USA, i.e. about 155/100,000. For women, Chile and Cuba had the highest rates in Latin America (114 and 103/100,000, respectively), again comparable to those of North America (around 105/100,000). These reflect the comparatively high mortality from cancer of the stomach (for Chile), lung and intestines (for Argentina) in men, and of stomach and uterus (for Chile), intestines and lung (for Cuba) in women. Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico had the lowest total cancer mortality for men, due to low mortality from stomach, colorectal and lung cancer. For women, the lowest rates were in Brazil and Puerto Rico, reflecting their low stomach and cervical cancer rates. In Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica and Venezuela cancer mortality rates tended to decline, particularly in men. Rates were stable in Ecuador and Puerto Rico, and were increasing in Mexico and Cuba. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality from some common cancers (including colorectal and lung) is still low in Latin America compared with Canada and the USA, and decreasing trends have been observed in the last decades for some cancer sites (including stomach, uterus, lung and other tobacco-related cancers) in several countries. However, mortality from female lung and breast cancers has been increasing in most countries of Latin America, and several countries still show an extremely elevated mortality from cancer of the cervix. Selected neoplasms amenable to treatment, including testis and leukemias, also show unsatisfactory trends in Latin America.},

We addressed this problem by using a reweighting technique in a logistic regression model to estimate parameters. Each survey weight was adjusted by the inverse of the probability that the possibly missing covariate was observed. The reweighted estimating equations procedure was compared with a complete case analysis (after discarding any subjects with missing data) in a simulation study to assess bias reduction. The method was also applied to data obtained from a national health survey (National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey or NHANES). Adjusting the sampling weights by the inverse probability of being completely observed appears to be effective in accounting for missing data and reducing the bias of the complete case estimate of the regression coefficients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Asthma is a heterogenetic disorder characterized by chronic inflammation with variable airflow obstruction and airway hyper-responsiveness. As the most potent and popular bronchodilators, beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2 AR) agonists bind to the beta2 ARs that are coupled via a stimulatory G protein to adenylyl cyclase, thereby improving cAMP accumulation and resulting in airway smooth muscle relaxation. We previously demonstrated arctigenin had a synergistic function with the beta2 AR agonist, but the target for this remained elusive. METHOD: Chemical proteomics capturing was used to enrich and uncover the target of arctigenin in human bronchial smooth muscle cells, and reverse docking and molecular dynamic stimulation were performed to evaluate the binding of arctigenin and its target. In vitro enzyme activities and protein levels were demonstrated with special kits and Western blotting. Finally, guinea pig tracheal muscle segregation and ex vivo function were analysed. RESULTS: Arctigenin bound to PDK1 with an ideal binding free energy -25.45 kcal/mol and inhibited PDK1 kinase activity without changing its protein level. Additionally, arctigenin reduced PKB/Akt-induced phosphorylation of PDE4D, which was first identified in this study. Attenuation of PDE4D resulted in cAMP accumulation in human bronchial smooth muscle. The inhibition of PDK1 showed a synergistic function with beta2 AR agonists and relaxed the constriction of segregated guinea pig tracheal muscle. CONCLUSIONS: The PDK1/Akt/PDE4D axis serves as a novel asthma target, which may benefit airflow obstruction.},

BACKGROUND
Current clinical tools have limited accuracy in differentiating patients with localized prostate cancer who are at risk of recurrence from patients with indolent disease. We aimed to identify a gene expression signature that jointly with clinical variables could improve upon the prediction of clinical recurrence after RP for patients with stage T2 PCa.

METHODS
The study population includes consented patients who underwent a radical retropubic prostatectomy (RP) and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection at the University of Southern California in the PSA-era (1988–2008). We used a nested case-control study of 187 organ-confined patients (pT2N0M0): 154 with no recurrence (“controls”) and 33 with clinical recurrence (“cases”). RNA was obtained from laser capture microdissected malignant glands representative of the overall Gleason score of each patient. Whole genome gene expression profiles (29,000 transcripts) were obtained using the Whole Genome DASL HT platform (Illumina, Inc). A gene expression signature of PCa clinical recurrence was identified using stability selection with elastic net regularized logistic regression. Three existing datasets generated with the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0ST array were used for validation: Mayo Clinic (MC, n = 545), Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (SKCC, n = 150), and Erasmus Medical Center (EMC, n = 48). The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) were obtained using repeated fivefold cross-validation.

RESULTS
A 28-gene expression signature was identified that jointly with key clinical variables (age, Gleason score, pre-operative PSA level, and operation year) was predictive of clinical recurrence (AUC of clinical variables only was 0.67, AUC of clinical variables, and 28-gene signature was 0.99). The AUC of this gene signature fitted in each of the external datasets jointly with clinical variables was 0.75 (0.72–0.77) (MC), 0.90 (0.86–0.94) (MSKCC), and 0.82 (0.74–0.91) (EMC), whereas the AUC for clinical variables only in each dataset was 0.72 (0.70–0.74), 0.86 (0.82–0.91), and 0.76 (0.67–0.85), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
We report a novel gene-expression based classifier identified using agnostic approaches from whole genome expression profiles that can improve upon the accuracy of clinical indicators to stratify early stage localized patients at risk of clinical recurrence after RP.

abstract = {High density oligonucleotide array technology is widely used in many areas of biomedical research for quantitative and highly parallel measurements of gene expression. Affymetrix GeneChip arrays are the most popular. In this technology each gene is typically represented by a set of 11-20 pairs of probes. In order to obtain expression measures it is necessary to summarize the probe level data. Using two extensive spike-in studies and a dilution study, we developed a set of tools for assessing the effectiveness of expression measures. We found that the performance of the current version of the default expression measure provided by Affymetrix Microarray Suite can be significantly improved by the use of probe level summaries derived from empirically motivated statistical models. In particular, improvements in the ability to detect differentially expressed genes are demonstrated.},

A total of 1,638,910 new cancer cases and 577,190 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2012. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2004-2008), overall cancer inci- dence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6{\%} per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8{\%} per year in men and by 1.6{\%} per year in women. Over the past 10 years of available data (1999- 2008), cancer death rates have declined by more than 1{\%} per year in men and women of every racial/ethnic group with the exception of American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom rates have remained stable. The most rapid declines in death rates occurred among African American and Hispanic men (2.4{\%} and 2.3{\%} per year, respectively). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate), with lung can- cer accounting for almost 40{\%} of the total decline in men and breast cancer accounting for 34{\%} of the total decline in women. The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of about 1,024,400 deaths from cancer. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population, with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeco- nomic bracket.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Disparities in breast cancer stage and mortality by race/ethnicity in the United States are persistent and well known. However, few studies have assessed differences across racial/ethnic subgroups of women broadly defined as Hispanic, Asian, or Pacific Islander, particularly using more recent data. METHODS: Using data from 17 population-based cancer registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, we evaluated the relationships between race/ethnicity and breast cancer stage, hormone receptor status, treatment, and mortality. The cohort consisted of 229,594 women 40-79 years of age diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma between January 2000 and December 2006, including 176,094 non-Hispanic whites, 20,486 blacks, 15,835 Hispanic whites, 14,951 Asians, 1,224 Pacific Islanders and 1,004 American Indians/Alaska Natives. RESULTS: With respect to statistically significant findings, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian Indian/Pakistani, black, Filipino, Hawaiian, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Samoan women had 1.3 to 7.1-fold higher odds of presenting with stage IV breast cancer compared to non-Hispanic white women. Almost all groups were more likely to be diagnosed with estrogen receptor-negative/progesterone receptor-negative (ER-/PR-) disease with black and Puerto Rican women having the highest odds ratios (2.4 and 1.9-fold increases, respectively) compared to non-Hispanic whites. Lastly, black, Hawaiian, Puerto Rican, and Samoan patients had 1.5 to 1.8-fold elevated risks of breast cancer specific mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer disparities persist by race/ethnicity, though there is substantial variation within subgroups of women broadly defined as Hispanic or Asian. Targeted, multi-pronged interventions that are culturally appropriate may be important means of reducing the magnitudes of these disparities.},

abstract = {SULT1A1 is involved in both detoxification of estrogens and bioactivation of carcinogens in smoked meat. SULT1A1 Arg213His polymorphism's effect on breast cancer risk is still unclear. We recruited 400 case-control pairs to investigate the association between SULT1A1 genotypes and breast cancer risk, and the combined effect of SULT1A1 polymorphism and daily intake of smoked meat. Participants were questioned about their dietary habits and other risk factors, and their SULT1A1 genotypes were determined. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by multivariable unconditional logistic regression. We also performed a meta-analysis of relevant published studies to test these associations. In the case-control study, no significant associations were observed between SULT1A1 polymorphism and breast cancer risk. In the meta-analysis, SULT1A1 His/His genotype slightly increased risk among both overall and postmenopausal women (OR(pooled-overall)=1.12, 95{\%} CI: 1.02-1.24; OR(pooled-post)=1.17, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-1.32). A larger positive association was observed in Asian populations (OR(pooled-Asian)=2.01, 95{\%} CI: 1.24-3.26). In our case-control study, high energy-adjusted daily intake of smoked meat was significantly associated with breast cancer risk in overall, pre- and postmenopausal women (aORs: 2.31-3.13, OR 95{\%} CIs exclude 1). High smoked meat intake interacted positively with the His variant allele (all $\gamma${\textgreater}1). These results correlated with those of the meta-analysis ($\gamma$(pooled-overall)=1.27). The SULT1A1 His/His genotype may increase the risk of breast cancer among Asian women, and dietary exposure to heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, along with the SULT1A1 His/His variant genotype, may synergistically increase the risk of breast cancer.},

abstract = {A well known, epidemiologically reproducible risk factor for human carcinomas is the long-term consumption of "red meat" of mammalian origin. Although multiple theories have attempted to explain this human-specific association, none have been conclusively proven. We used an improved method to survey common foods for free and glycosidically bound forms of the nonhuman sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), showing that it is highly and selectively enriched in red meat. The bound form of Neu5Gc is bioavailable, undergoing metabolic incorporation into human tissues, despite being a foreign antigen. Interactions of this antigen with circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies could potentially incite inflammation. Indeed, when human-like Neu5Gc-deficient mice were fed bioavailable Neu5Gc and challenged with anti-Neu5Gc antibodies, they developed evidence of systemic inflammation. Such mice are already prone to develop occasional tumors of the liver, an organ that can incorporate dietary Neu5Gc. Neu5Gc-deficient mice immunized against Neu5Gc and fed bioavailable Neu5Gc developed a much higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas, with evidence of Neu5Gc accumulation. Taken together, our data provide an unusual mechanistic explanation for the epidemiological association between red meat consumption and carcinoma risk. This mechanism might also contribute to other chronic inflammatory processes epidemiologically associated with red meat consumption.},

Dietary intake was assessed at baseline using a validated 276-item food use questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for known or suspected risk factors for prostate cancer. During 17 years of follow-up, we ascertained 1,267 incident cases of prostate cancer. High versus low intake of dietary calcium was associated with a marked increase in prostate cancer risk. The multivariate relative risk (RR) of prostate cancer for {\textgreater} or =2,000 mg/day compared to {\textless}1,000 mg/day of calcium intake was 1.63 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.27-2.10; p trend {\textless} 0.0001). Total dairy intake was also positively associated with risk of prostate cancer. The multivariate RR of prostate cancer comparing extreme quintiles of intake was 1.26 (95{\%} CI, 1.04-1.51; p trend = 0.03). However, no association with total dairy intake remained after we adjusted for calcium (p trend = 0.17). Findings were similar by stage and grade of prostate cancer.

Two diet patterns were identified: vegetable-fruit-soy-milk-poultry-fish pattern and refined grain-meat-pickle pattern. After adjustment for confounders, a 74{\%} decreased risk was observed among women in the highest quartile of the vegetable-fruit-soy-milk-poultry-fish dietary pattern relative to the lowest quartile (OR = 0.26, 95{\%} CI = 0.17-0.42).

Only 5-10{\%} of all cancer cases can be attributed to genetic defects, whereas the remaining 90-95{\%} have their roots in the environment and lifestyle. The lifestyle factors include cigarette smoking, diet (fried foods, red meat), alcohol, sun exposure, environmental pollutants, infections, stress, obesity, and physical inactivity. The evidence indicates that of all cancer-related deaths, almost 25-30{\%} are due to tobacco, as many as 30-35{\%} are linked to diet, about 15-20{\%} are due to infections, and the remaining percentage are due to other factors like radiation, stress, physical activity, environmental pollutants etc. Therefore, cancer prevention requires smoking cessation, increased ingestion of fruits and vegetables, moderate use of alcohol, caloric restriction, exercise, avoidance of direct exposure to sunlight, minimal meat consumption, use of whole grains, use of vaccinations, and regular check-ups. In this review, we present evidence that inflammation is the link between the agents/factors that cause cancer and the agents that prevent it. In addition, we provide evidence that cancer is a preventable disease that requires major lifestyle changes.},

abstract = {Heterocyclic amines found in well-done meat require host-mediated metabolic activation before initiating DNA mutations and tumors in target organs. Polymorphic N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT2) catalyzes the activation of heterocyclic amines via O-acetylation, suggesting that NAT2 genotypes with high O-acetyltransferase activity (rapid/intermediate acetylator phenotype) increase the risk of breast cancer in women who consume well-done meat. To test this hypothesis, DNA samples and information on diet and other breast cancer risk factors were obtained from a nested case-control study of postmenopausal women. Twenty-seven NAT2 genotypes were determined and assigned to rapid, intermediate, or slow acetylator groups based on published characterizations of recombinant NAT2 allozymes. NAT2 genotype alone was not associated with breast cancer risk. A significant dose-response relationship was observed between breast cancer risk and consumption of well-done meat among women with the rapid/intermediate NAT2 genotype (trend test, P = 0.003) that was not evident among women with the slow acetylator genotype (trend test, P = 0.22). These results suggest an interaction between NAT2 genotype and meat doneness, although a test for multiplicative interaction was not statistically significant (P = 0.06). Among women with the rapid/intermediate NAT2 genotype, consumption of well-done meat was associated with a nearly 8-fold (odds ratio, 7.6; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.1-50.4) elevated breast cancer risk compared with those consuming rare or medium-done meats. These results are consistent with a role for O-acetylation in the activation of heterocyclic amine carcinogens and support the hypothesis that the NAT2 acetylation polymorphism is a breast cancer risk factor among postmenopausal women with high levels of heterocyclic amine exposure.},

We investigated the association between red meat and poultry intake and localized and advanced PCA taking into account cooking practices and polymorphisms in enzymes that metabolize carcinogens that accumulate in cooked meats. We analyzed data for 1096 controls, 717 localized and 1140 advanced cases from the California Collaborative Prostate Cancer Study, a multiethnic, population-based case-control study. We examined nutrient density-adjusted intake of red meat and poultry and tested for effect modification by 12 SNPs and 2 copy number variants in 10 carcinogen metabolism genes: GSTP1, PTGS2, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, EPHX1, CYP1B1, UGT1A6, NAT2, GSTM1 and GSTT1. We observed a positive association between risk of advanced PCA and high intake of red meat cooked at high temperatures (trend P = 0.026), cooked by pan-frying (trend P = 0.035), and cooked until well-done (trend P = 0.013). An inverse association was observed for baked poultry and advanced PCA risk (trend P = 0.023). A gene-by-diet interaction was observed between an SNP in the PTGS2 gene and the estimated levels of meat mutagens (interaction P = 0.008). Our results support a role for carcinogens that accumulate in meats cooked at high temperatures as potential PCA risk factors, and may support a role for heterocyclic amines (HCAs) in PCA etiology.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To investigate the components of adolescent diet that may influence risk of breast cancer as an adult. METHODS Retrospective cohort study among 47,355 participants in the Nurses Health Study II who answered a 131-item food frequency questionnaire about diet during high school. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate relative risks and 95{\%} confidence intervals among incident cases of breast cancer between 1989 (inception of the study) and 1998 (when high school diet was assessed). RESULTS Intakes of fat and fiber were not significantly related to risk of breast cancer in multivariate analysis, but increased intake of vegetable fat ( Q (5) versus Q (1) multivariate RR = 0.58, 95{\%} CI (0.38-0.86); test for trend p = 0.005) and vitamin E ( Q (5) versus Q (1) multivariate RR = 0.61, 95{\%} CI (0.42-0.89); test for trend p = 0.003) were associated with a lower risk. A higher dietary glycemic index ( Q (5) versus Q (1) multivariate RR = 1.47, 95{\%} CI (1.04-2.08); test for trend p = 0.01) was associated with increased risk of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS The apparent protective effects of vegetable fat and vitamin E and adverse effect of high glycemic foods on risk of breast cancer need confirmation in prospective analyses.},

abstract = {Considerable epidemiological data have accumulated in support of a lower risk of breast cancer among physically active women. Few studies, however, have examined the relation with lifetime physical activity from all sources, and moderate activity in particular. We conducted a population-based case-control study of breast cancer in Latinas, African Americans, and whites aged 35-79 years to assess the association with lifetime histories of moderate and vigorous physical activity, including recreational activity, walking, bicycling, household and outdoor chores, and occupation. Patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 1995 and 1998 were identified through the cancer registry in the San Francisco Bay area, and a random sample of women without breast cancer was identified through random-digit dialing. A structured questionnaire administered in-person was completed by 403 premenopausal cases and 483 controls and 847 postmenopausal cases and 1065 controls. Summing activities from all sources over an individual's lifetime, we found reduced breast cancer risk in both pre- and postmenopausal women with the highest versus lowest tertile of average lifetime activity (premenopausal: multivariate adjusted odds ratio = 0.74, 95{\%} confidence interval = 0.52-1.05; postmenopausal: odds ratio = 0.81, 95{\%} confidence interval = 0.64-1.02), with similar reductions in the three racial/ethnic groups. In premenopausal women, risk reductions were similar for different types of activities, whereas in postmenopausal women, they were limited to occupational activity. Considering the intensity of activities, risk reductions were similar for moderate and vigorous activities. Because few of the currently known risk factors for breast cancer are modifiable, these results underline the public health importance of promoting physically active lifestyles.},

The current availability of high-volume genetic data, the wide range in types of environmental data that can be measured, and the formation of consortia of multiple studies provide new opportunities to identify GxE interactions, but also new analytic challenges. In this paper, we summarize several statistical approaches that can be used to test for GxE interaction in a genomewide association study. These include both traditional models of GxE interaction in a case-control or quantitative trait study, as well as alternative approaches that can provide substantially greater power. The latest methods for analyzing GxE with gene sets and with data in a consortium setting are summarized, as are issues that arise due to the complexity of environmental data. We provide some speculation on why detecting GxE interactions in a genomewide association study has thus far been difficult. We conclude with a description of software programs that can be used to implement most of the methods described in the paper.},

From the analysis of the molecular genesis of colon cancer, four central tenets concerning the pathogenesis of cancer have been established. The first is that the genetic and epigenetic alterations that underlie colon cancer formation promote the cancer formation process because they provide a clonal growth advantage to the cells that acquire them. The second tenet is that cancer emerges via a multi-step progression at both the molecular and the morphologic level. The third is that loss of genomic stability is a key molecular step in cancer formation. The fourth is that hereditary cancer syndromes frequently correspond to germ line forms of key genetic defects whose somatic occurrences drive the emergence of sporadic colon cancers.},

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

Advances in the field over the last several decades have been remarkable and have clearly translated into better patient care as evidenced by the earlier detection, better prognosis, and new targeted therapies. There have been two recent advances in the breast cancer research field that have lead to paradigm shifts: first, the identification of intrinsic breast tumor subtypes, which has changed the way we think about breast cancer and second, the recent characterization of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are suspected to be responsible for tumor initiation, recurrence and resistance to therapy, have opened new exciting avenues to think about breast cancer therapeutic strategies. While these advances constitute major paradigm shifts within the research realm, the clinical arena has yet to adopt and apply our understanding of the molecular basis of the disease to early diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of breast cancers. Here, we will review the current clinical approach to classification of breast cancers, newer molecular-based classification schemes, and potential future of biomarkers representing a functional classification of breast cancer.},

We evaluate associations by ethnicity, menopausal status, and tumor ER/PR status after adjusting for genetic admixture. TNRC9 AA genotype was associated with significant increased risk among NHW women (OR 1.54, 95{\%} CI 1.14, 2.08; P trend 0.003). Both polymorphisms of FGFR2 were associated with statistically significant increased risk for NHW and Hispanic women; MAP3K1 was not associated with risk among either ethnic group. The polymorphism on 2q35 was associated with a statistically significant increased risk among Hispanic women (OR 1.53, 95{\%} CI 1.08, 2.15 for the AA genotype; P trend = 0.004). Associations were significantly different among pre/peri-menopausal women for TNRC9 (P heterogeneity 0.008) and for 2q35 (P heterogeneity 0.08) for NHW and Hispanic women. Both FGFR2 polymorphisms reduced risk of ER-/PR- tumors in the presence of the minor allele among NHW women. Among Hispanic women, polymorphisms of the FGFR2 gene were associated with almost a twofold increase risk of an ER+/PR+ tumor, while non-significantly inversely associated with ER-/PR- tumors. Our data replicated some of the previously reported GWAS findings. Differences in associations were detected for NHW and Hispanic women by menopausal status and by ER/PR status of tumors.},

abstract = {The popular Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) software uses the random-effects models for estimating the narrow-sense heritability based on GWAS data of unrelated individuals without knowing and identifying the causal loci. Many methods have since extended this approach to various situations. However, since the proportion of causal loci among the variants is typically very small and GCTA uses all variants to calculate the similarities among individuals, the estimation of heritability may be unstable, resulting in a large variance of the estimates. Moreover, if the causal SNPs are not genotyped, GCTA sometimes greatly underestimates the true heritability. We present a novel narrow-sense heritability estimator, named HERRA, using well-developed ultra-high dimensional machine-learning methods, applicable to continuous or dichotomous outcomes, as other existing methods. Additionally, HERRA is applicable to time-to-event or age-at-onset outcome, which, to our knowledge, no existing method can handle. Compared to GCTA and LDAK for continuous and binary outcomes, HERRA often has a smaller variance, and when causal SNPs are not genotyped, HERRA has a much smaller empirical bias. We applied GCTA, LDAK and HERRA to a large colorectal cancer dataset using dichotomous outcome (4,312 cases, 4,356 controls, genotyped using Illumina 300K), the respective heritability estimates of GCTA, LDAK and HERRA are 0.068 (SE = 0.017), 0.072 (SE = 0.021) and 0.110 (SE = 5.19 x 10−3). HERRA yields over 50{\%} increase in heritability estimate compared to GCTA or LDAK.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Guidelines for initiating colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are based on family history but do not consider lifestyle, environmental, or genetic risk factors. We developed models to determine risk of CRC, based on lifestyle and environmental factors and genetic variants, and to identify an optimal age to begin screening. Methods: We collected data from 9748 CRC cases and 10,590 controls in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium and the Colorectal Transdisciplinary study, from 1992 through 2005. Half of the participants were used to develop the risk determination model and the other half were used to evaluate the discriminatory accuracy (validation set). Models of CRC risk were created based on family history, 19 lifestyle and environmental factors (E-score), and 63 CRC-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified in genome-wide association studies (G-score). We evaluated the discriminatory accuracy of the models by calculating area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values, adjusting for study, age, and endoscopy history for the validation set. We used the models to project the 10-year absolute risk of CRC for a given risk profile and recommend ages to begin screening in comparison to CRC risk for an average individual at 50 years of age, using external population incidence rates for non-Hispanic whites from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program registry. Results: In our models, E-score and G-score each determined risk of CRC with greater accuracy than family history. A model that combined both scores and family history estimated CRC risk with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.63 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.62–0.64) for men and 0.62 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.61–0.63) for women; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values based on only family history ranged from 0.53 to 0.54 and those based only E-score or G-score ranged from 0.59 to 0.60. Although screening is recommended to begin at age 50 years for individuals with no family history of CRC, starting ages calculated based on combined E-score and G-score differed by 12 years for men and 14 for women, for individuals with the highest vs the lowest 10{\%} of risk. Conclusions: We used data from 2 large international consortia to develop CRC risk calculation models that included genetic and environmental factors along with family history. These determine risk of CRC and starting ages for screening with greater accuracy than the family history only model, which is based on the current screening guideline. These scoring systems might serve as a first step toward developing individualized CRC prevention strategies.},

Total meat and processed meat were directly related to the risk of stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, breast (mainly postmenopausal), prostate, testis, kidney, bladder, and leukemia. Red meat was significantly associated with colon, lung (mainly in men), and bladder cancer. No relation was observed for cancer of the ovary, brain, and NHL. No consistent excess risk emerged for fish and poultry, which were inversely related to the risk of a number of cancer sites. These findings add further evidence that meat, specifically red and processed meat, plays an unfavorable role in the risk of several cancers. Fish and poultry appear to be favorable diet indicators.},

abstract = {The liver kinase B1 (LKB1) is encoded by the STK11 gene and acts as a tumour suppressor and a regulator of energy homeostasis. LKB1 expression is reduced in primary breast tumours compared to normal breast epithelium. Although its expression in primary tumours does not appear to correlate with estrogen receptor (ER) status, it is differentially expressed in breast cancer cell lines where ER-negative cells have lower LKB1 expression than ER-positive cells. The present study aimed to examine the effects of estradiol on LKB1 expression and activity in the ER-positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Results demonstrate that estradiol causes a dose-dependent decrease in LKB1 transcript and protein expression and consistent with this, a significant decrease in the phosphorylation of the LKB1 target AMPK (P ≤ 0.05). In order to assess whether effects of estradiol were due to effects on ER$\alpha$ binding to the STK11 promoter, ChIP was performed. Results demonstrate that ER$\alpha$ binds to the STK11 promoter in a ligand-independent manner and that this interaction is decreased in the presence of estradiol. Moreover, STK11 promoter activity is significantly decreased in the presence of estradiol (P ≤ 0.05).

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 58 susceptibility alleles across 37 regions associated with the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) with P{\textless}5x10-8. Most studies have been conducted in non-Hispanic whites and East Asians; however, the generalizability of these findings and the potential for ethnic-specific risk variation in Hispanic and Latino (HL) individuals have been largely understudied. We describe the first GWAS of common genetic variation contributing to CRC risk in HL (1,611 CRC cases and 4,330 controls). We also examine known susceptibility alleles and implement imputation-based fine-mapping to identify potential ethnicity-specific association signals in known risk regions. We discovered 17 variants across 4 independent regions that merit further investigation due to suggestive CRC associations (P{\textless}1x10-6) at 1p34.3 (rs7528276; Odds Ratio (OR)=1.86 (95{\%} Confidence Interval (CI): 1.47-2.36); P = 2.5x10-7), 2q23.3 (rs1367374; OR=1.37 (95{\%} CI: 1.21-1.55); P = 4.0x10-7), 14q24.2 (rs143046984; OR=1.65 (95{\%} CI: 1.36-2.01); P = 4.1x10-7), and 16q12.2 (rs142319636; OR=1.69 (95{\%} CI: 1.37-2.08); P=7.8x10-7). Among the 57 previously published CRC susceptibility alleles with minor allele frequency[{\&}ge;]1{\%}, 76.5{\%} of SNPs had a consistent direction of effect, and 19(33.3{\%}) were nominally statistically significant (P{\textless}0.05). Further, rs185423955 and rs60892987 were identified as novel secondary susceptibility variants at 3q26.2 (P=5.3 x 10-5) and 11q12.2 (P=6.8x10-5), respectively. Our findings demonstrate the importance of fine-mapping in HL. These results are informative for variant prioritization in functional studies and future risk prediction modeling in minority populations.},

However, it is not clear whether meat, red meat, heterocyclic amines (HCA), or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are associated with the risk for rectal cancer. Rectal cancer cases (n = 952) and controls (n = 1205) from Utah and Northern California were recruited from a population-based case-control study between September 1997 and February 2002. Detailed in-person interviews regarding lifestyle, medical history, and diet were conducted. DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes obtained from whole-blood samples, and glutathione S-transferase (GST)M1 enzyme and N-acetyl transferase (NAT)2 enzyme genotypes were assessed. Although energy and cholesterol intakes were higher among cases than controls, adjustment for confounders accounted for the differences. Increased consumption of well-done red meat [odds ratio (OR) 1.33 95{\%} CI 0.98, 1.79] was associated with an (P = 0.04) increase in risk for rectal cancer among men. The mutagen index, calculated on the bases of reported amount, doneness, and method of cooking meat, was also positively but not significantly (P = 0.24) associated with risk of rectal cancer for men (OR 1.37 95{\%} CI 0.98, 1.92). NAT2-imputed phenotype and GSTM1 did not consistently modify rectal cancer risk associated with meat intake. These data suggest that mutagens such as HCA that form when meat is cooked may be culpable substances in rectal cancer risk, not red meat itself.},

This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then speci{\"{y}}c to a particular treatment eeect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment eeect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the 2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random eeects meta-analysis to the standard error of a {\"{y}}xed eeect meta-analytic estimate, and I 2 is a transformation of H that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in {\"{y}}ve example data sets showing diierent amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I 2 , which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to the identification of a number of common susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer (CRC); however, none of these GWAS have considered gene-environment (G × E) interactions. Therefore, it is unclear whether current hits are modified by environmental exposures or whether there are additional hits whose effects are dependent on environmental exposures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic search for G × E interactions using genome wide data from the Colon Cancer Family Registry that included 1,191 cases of microsatellite stable (MSS) or microsatellite instability-low (MSI-L) CRC and 999 controls genotyped using either the Illumina Human1M or Human1M-Duo BeadChip. We tested for interactions between genotypes and 14 environmental factors using 3 methods: a traditional case-control test, a case-only test, and the recently proposed 2-step method by Murcray and colleagues. All potentially significant findings were replicated in the ARCTIC Study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: No G × E interactions were identified that reached genome-wide significance by any of the 3 methods. When analyzing previously reported susceptibility loci, 7 significant G × E interactions were found at a 5{\%} significance level. We investigated these 7 interactions in an independent sample and none of the interactions were replicated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Identifying G × E interactions will present challenges in a GWAS setting. Our power calculations illustrate the need for larger sample sizes; however, as CRC is a heterogeneous disease, a tradeoff between increasing sample size and heterogeneity needs to be considered.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIMPACT: The results from this first genome-wide analysis of G × E in CRC identify several challenges, which may be addressed by large consortium efforts.},

abstract = {Aromatic amines and heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) are structurally related classes of carcinogens that are formed during the combustion of tobacco or during the high-temperature cooking of meats. Both classes of procarcinogens undergo metabolic activation by N-hydroxylation of the exocyclic amine group to produce a common proposed intermediate, the arylnitrenium ion, which is the critical metabolite implicated in toxicity and DNA damage. However, the biochemistry and chemical properties of these compounds are distinct, and different biomarkers of aromatic amines and HAAs have been developed for human biomonitoring studies. Hemoglobin adducts have been extensively used as biomarkers to monitor occupational and environmental exposures to a number of aromatic amines; however, HAAs do not form hemoglobin adducts at appreciable levels, and other biomarkers have been sought. A number of epidemiologic studies that have investigated dietary consumption of well-done meat in relation to various tumor sites reported a positive association between cancer risk and well-done meat consumption, although some studies have shown no associations between well-done meat and cancer risk. A major limiting factor in most epidemiological studies is the uncertainty in quantitative estimates of chronic exposure to HAAs, and thus, the association of HAAs formed in cooked meat and cancer risk has been difficult to establish. There is a critical need to establish long-term biomarkers of HAAs that can be implemented in molecular epidemioIogy studies. In this review, we highlight and contrast the biochemistry of several prototypical carcinogenic aromatic amines and HAAs to which humans are chronically exposed. The biochemical properties and the impact of polymorphisms of the major xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes on the biological effects of these chemicals are examined. Lastly, the analytical approaches that have been successfully employed to biomonitor aromatic amines and HAAs, and emerging biomarkers of HAAs that may be implemented in molecular epidemiology studies are discussed.},

However, it is currently unclear how gene-environment interaction can best be used to locate complex disease susceptibility loci, particularly in the context of studies where between 1,000 and 1,000,000 markers are scanned for association with disease. We present a joint test of marginal association and gene-environment interaction for case-control data. We compare the power and sample size requirements of this joint test to other analyses: the marginal test of genetic association, the standard test for gene-environment interaction based on logistic regression, and the case-only test for interaction that exploits gene-environment independence. Although for many penetrance models the joint test of genetic marginal effect and interaction is not the most powerful, it is nearly optimal across all penetrance models we considered. In particular, it generally has better power than the marginal test when the genetic effect is restricted to exposed subjects and much better power than the tests of gene-environment interaction when the genetic effect is not restricted to a particular exposure level. This makes the joint test an attractive tool for large-scale association scans where the true gene-environment interaction model is unknown.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifactorial disease with several hypothesized etiologic factors including inflammatory processes; hormones such as estrogen, androgen, and insulin; and energy-related factors. We present evidence that integrates these elements in a pathway we call the convergence of hormones, inflammation, and energy-related factors (CHIEF). First, given the physiology of the gut, substantial epidemiologic and molecular data support the hypothesis that activation of innate immunity in the normal gut mucosa by various environmental agents (commensal bacteria, dietary antigens, mucosal irritants, pathogens) and endogenous factors such as estrogen, androgens, and insulin levels provokes basal inflammation as an underlying factor of the association of insulin, estrogen, and energy-related factors with CRC. Second, critical genes involved in this pathway, e.g., phosphatase tensin homologue on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and serine threonine kinase 11 (STK11)/LKB1, are tumor suppressor genes often mutated in intestinal cancer or CRC. Third, laboratory experiments show that cellular PTEN and STK11/LKB1 tumor suppressor enzymes are vulnerable to inactivation by redox-active species, especially chemically reactive lipid mediators of inflammation and redox stress. Epidemiologic data further support the underlying proposal that CHIEF comprises important elements of CRC risk. Although this discussion of the CHIEF pathway focuses on CRC, we believe that this pathway may play an important role in the etiology of other cancers as well.},

abstract = {Microsatellite instability (MSI) occurs in approximately 15{\%} of colon tumors. Other than relatively rare mutations in mismatch repair genes, the causes of MSI are not generally known. The purpose of this study was to determine if dietary intake of nutrients previously reported as being associated with colon cancer relate specifically to the MSI disease pathway. Data from a population-based case-control study of adenocarcinoma of the colon were used to evaluate associations between dietary intake and MSI. Participants were between 30 and 79 years of age at time of diagnosis and included both men and women. Dietary intake data were obtained from a computerized diet history questionnaire. MSI was evaluated in several ways: by a panel of 10 tetranucleotide repeats, and by 2 mononucleotide repeats, BAT-26 and TGFbetaRII. A total of 1,510 cases had valid study data and tumor DNA on which we were able to obtain MSI status. Cases with and without MSI were compared with dietary data reported by 2,410 population-based controls to determine dietary associations that may be different for these 2 subsets of cases. We compared dietary intake for cases with and without MSI to further determine associations that are specific to the MSI disease pathway. When comparing MSI+ to MSI- tumors we observed that long-term alcohol consumption, especially intake of liquor, increased the probability of having a tumor with MSI [odds ratio (OR) for MSI+ vs. MSI- tumors for alcohol 1.6, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.0-2.5; OR for liquor 1.6, 95{\%} CI 1.1-2.4]. The likelihood of having MSI in the tumor from the combined effects of high alcohol consumption and smoking cigarettes showed a 70{\%} excess in risk from the additive model. There were some suggestions that high intakes of refined grain might also be associated with MSI+ tumors, although associations were less consistent. Risk estimates for most other dietary factors did not differ substantially by MSI status. Data from this large population-based case-control study of colon cancer indicate that alcohol consumption, especially consumption of liquor, may increase the odds of an MSI+ tumor. Most other dietary factors do not appear operate exclusively in the MSI+ disease pathway.},

abstract = {Disparities in poverty and health care access barriers have a negative impact on the health and wellness of population subsets that bear a disproportionate share of these socioeconomic disadvantages, such as African Americans and Hispanic/Latina Americans. The more advanced stage distribution of breast cancer in these two population subsets is likely related to imbalance in distribution of socioeconomic resources in the United States. However, differences in the breast cancer burden of population subsets defined by racial/ethnic identity are also influenced by race/ethnicity-associated variation in tumor biology and hereditary susceptibility. Compared with white Americans, African-American women have higher population-based breast cancer mortality rates, which are at least partly explained by an increased risk for the biologically aggressive triple-negative phenotype. International studies correlate West African ancestry with predisposition for triple-negative breast cancer. In contrast, Hispanic/Latina Americans have lower population-based incidence and mortality rates for breast cancer despite their increased rates of socioeconomic challenges. Genetic studies suggest that extent of Native American ancestry among Hispanic/Latina women may reduce breast cancer risk. Eradication of disparate access to breast cancer early detection and treatment strategies is a public health imperative, but research to elucidate the genetics of breast cancer related to racial/ethnic identity is equally important as we strive to comprehensively define this complex disease.},

abstract = {Background The American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) collaborate to provide annual updates on cancer occurrence and trends in the United States. This Annual Report highlights survival rates. Data were from the CDC- and NCI-funded population-based cancer registry programs and compiled by NAACCR. Trends in age-standardized incidence and death rates for all cancers combined and for the leading cancer types by sex were estimated by joinpoint analysis and expressed as annual percent change. We used relative survival ratios and adjusted relative risk of death after a diagnosis of cancer (hazard ratios [HRs]) using Cox regression model to examine changes or differences in survival over time and by sociodemographic factors. Results Overall cancer death rates from 2010 to 2014 decreased by 1.8{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = -1.8 to -1.8) per year in men, by 1.4{\%} (95{\%} CI = -1.4 to -1.3) per year in women, and by 1.6{\%} (95{\%} CI = -2.0 to -1.3) per year in children. Death rates decreased for 11 of the 16 most common cancer types in men and for 13 of the 18 most common cancer types in women, including lung, colorectal, female breast, and prostate, whereas death rates increased for liver (men and women), pancreas (men), brain (men), and uterine cancers. In contrast, overall incidence rates from 2009 to 2013 decreased by 2.3{\%} (95{\%} CI = -3.1 to -1.4) per year in men but stabilized in women. For several but not all cancer types, survival statistically significantly improved over time for both early and late-stage diseases. Between 1975 and 1977, and 2006 and 2012, for example, five-year relative survival for distant-stage disease statistically significantly increased from 18.7{\%} (95{\%} CI = 16.9{\%} to 20.6{\%}) to 33.6{\%} (95{\%} CI = 32.2{\%} to 35.0{\%}) for female breast cancer but not for liver cancer (from 1.1{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 0.3{\%} to 2.9{\%}, to 2.3{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 1.6{\%} to 3.2{\%}). Survival varied by race/ethnicity and state. For example, the adjusted relative risk of death for all cancers combined was 33{\%} (HR = 1.33, 95{\%} CI = 1.32 to 1.34) higher in non-Hispanic blacks and 51{\%} (HR = 1.51, 95{\%} CI = 1.46 to 1.56) higher in non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native compared with non-Hispanic whites. Conclusions Cancer death rates continue to decrease in the United States. However, progress in reducing death rates and improving survival is limited for several cancer types, underscoring the need for intensified efforts to discover new strategies for prevention, early detection, and treatment and to apply proven preventive measures broadly and equitably.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Women with early-stage breast cancers are expected to have excellent survival rates. It is important to identify factors that predict diagnosis of early-stage breast cancers. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of breast cancers that were identified at an early stage (stage I) in different racial/ethnic groups and whether ethnic differences may be better explained by early detection or by intrinsic biological differences in tumor aggressiveness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational study of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from 2004 to 2011 who were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 registries database (N = 452,215). For each of 8 racial/ethnic groups, biological aggressiveness (triple-negative cancers, lymph node metastases, and distant metastases) of small-sized tumors of 2.0 cm or less was estimated. The odds ratio (OR) for being diagnosed at stage I compared with a later stage and the hazard ratio (HR) for death from stage I breast cancer by racial/ethnic group were determined. The date of final follow-up was December 31, 2011. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Breast cancer stage at diagnosis and 7-year breast cancer-specific survival, adjusted for age at diagnosis, income, and estrogen receptor status. RESULTS: Of 373,563 women with invasive breast cancer, 268,675 (71.9{\%}) were non-Hispanic white; 34,928 (9.4{\%}), Hispanic white; 38,751 (10.4{\%}), black; 25,211 (6.7{\%}), Asian; and 5998 (1.6{\%}), other ethnicities. Mean follow-up time was 40.6 months (median, 38 months). Compared with non-Hispanic white women diagnosed with stage I breast cancer (50.8{\%}), Japanese women (56.1{\%}) were more likely to be diagnosed (OR, 1.23 [95{\%} CI, 1.15-1.31], P {\textless} .001) and black women (37.0{\%}) were less likely to be diagnosed (OR, 0.65 [95{\%} CI, 0.64-0.67], P {\textless} .001). Actuarial risk of death from stage I breast cancer at 7 years was higher among black women (6.2{\%}) than non-Hispanic white women (3.0{\%}) (HR, 1.57 [95{\%} CI, 1.40-1.75]; P {\textless} .001), and lower among South Asian women (1.7{\%}) (HR, 0.48 [95{\%} CI, 0.20-1.15]; P = .10). Black women were more likely to die of breast cancer with small-sized tumors (9.0{\%}) than non-Hispanic white women (4.6{\%}) (HR, 1.96 [95{\%} CI, 1.82-2.12]; P {\textless} .001); the difference remained after adjustment for income and estrogen receptor status (HR, 1.56 [95{\%} CI, 1.45-1.69]; P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among US women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, the likelihood of diagnosis at an early stage, and survival after stage I diagnosis, varied by race and ethnicity. Much of the difference could be statistically accounted for by intrinsic biological differences such as lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and triple-negative behavior of tumors.},

abstract = {In this study, we examined the available evidence and sources of heterogeneity for studies of dairy products, calcium, and vitamin D intake and the risk of prostate cancer. We pooled data from 45 observational studies using a general variance-based, meta-analytic method employing CIs. Summary relative risks (RRs) were calculated for specific dairy products such as milk and dairy micronutrients. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of these summary measures of effect. Cohort studies showed no evidence of an association between dairy [RR = 1.06; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.92-1.22] or milk intake (RR = 1.06; 95{\%} CI = 0.91-1.23) and risk of prostate cancer. This was supported by pooled results of case-control analyses (RR = 1.14; 95{\%} CI = 1.00-1.29), although studies using milk as the exposure of interest were heterogeneous and could not be combined. Calcium data from cohort studies were heterogeneous. Case-control analyses using calcium as the exposure of interest demonstrated no association with increased risk of prostate cancer (RR = 1.04; 95{\%} CI = 0.90-1.15). Dietary intake of vitamin D also was not related to prostate cancer risk (RR = 1.16; 95{\%} CI = 0.98-1.38). The data from observational studies do not support an association between dairy product use and an increased risk of prostate cancer.},

abstract = {Consuming a Mediterranean diet rich in minimally processed plant foods has been associated with a reduced risk of developing multiple chronic diseases and increased life expectancy. Data from several randomized clinic trials have demonstrated a beneficial effect in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and breast cancer. The exact mechanism by which an increased adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet exerts its favorable effects is not known. However, accumulating evidence indicates that the five most important adaptations induced by the Mediterranean dietary pattern are: (a) lipid-lowering effect, (b) protection against oxidative stress, inflammation and platelet aggregation, (c) modification of hormones and growth factors involved in the pathogenesis of cancer, (d) inhibition of nutrient sensing pathways by specific amino acid restriction, and (e) gut microbiota-mediated production of metabolites influencing metabolic health. More studies are needed to understand how single modifications of nutrients typical of the Mediterranean diet interact with energy intake, energy expenditure, and the microbiome in modulating the key mechanisms that promote cellular, tissue, and organ health during aging.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Red meat and processed meat have been associated with carcinogenesis at several anatomic sites, but no prospective study has examined meat intake in relation to a range of malignancies. We investigated whether red or processed meat intake increases cancer risk at a variety of sites. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP (formerly the American Association for Retired Persons) Diet and Health Study is a cohort of approximately 500,000 people aged 50-71 y at baseline (1995-1996). Meat intake was estimated from a food frequency questionnaire administered at baseline. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals within quintiles of red and processed meat intake. During up to 8.2 y of follow-up, 53,396 incident cancers were ascertained. Statistically significant elevated risks (ranging from 20{\%} to 60{\%}) were evident for esophageal, colorectal, liver, and lung cancer, comparing individuals in the highest with those in the lowest quintile of red meat intake. Furthermore, individuals in the highest quintile of processed meat intake had a 20{\%} elevated risk for colorectal and a 16{\%} elevated risk for lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Both red and processed meat intakes were positively associated with cancers of the colorectum and lung; furthermore, red meat intake was associated with an elevated risk for cancers of the esophagus and liver.},

In the conventional logistic regression analysis, the SNP rs2965667 at chromosome 12p12.3 near the MGST1 gene showed a genome-wide significant interaction with aspirin and/or NSAID use (P = 4.6 × 10(-9) for interaction). Aspirin and/or NSAID use was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer among individuals with rs2965667-TT genotype (prevalence, 28{\%} vs 38{\%}; OR, 0.66 [95{\%} CI, 0.61-0.70]; P = 7.7 × 10(-33)) but with a higher risk among those with rare (4{\%}) TA or AA genotypes (prevalence, 35{\%} vs 29{\%}; OR, 1.89 [95{\%} CI, 1.27-2.81]; P = .002).

abstract = {An association between heavy alcohol drinking and gastric cancer risk has been recently reported, but the issue is still open to discussion and quantification. We investigated the role of alcohol drinking on gastric cancer risk in the "Stomach cancer Pooling (StoP) Project," a consortium of epidemiological studies. A total of 9,669 cases and 25,336 controls from 20 studies from Europe, Asia and North America were included. We estimated summary odds-ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) by pooling study-specific ORs using random-effects meta-regression models. Compared with abstainers, drinkers of up to 4 drinks/day of alcohol had no increase in gastric cancer risk, while the ORs were 1.26 (95{\%} CI, 1.08-1.48) for heavy ({\textgreater}4 to 6 drinks/day) and 1.48 (95{\%} CI 1.29-1.70) for very heavy ({\textgreater}6 drinks/day) drinkers.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We studied whether polymorphisms in N-acetyltransferase 1 and 2 and Glutathione S-transferase M1 and T1 genes modify the association between meat consumption and breast cancer. METHODS: A nested case control was conducted in a Dutch prospective cohort. Breast cancer cases (229) and controls (264) were frequency matched on age, town and menopausal status. RESULTS: There is no relation between any type of meat consumption ( i.e., total meat, processed meat, fresh meat, red meat and white meat) and breast cancer risk. Neither presence of NAT1 or NAT2 rapid genotype, or GSTT1 null genotype, alone or in combination with meat consumption affects breast cancer risk. Absence of GSTM1 shows 46{\%} increased breast cancer risk (OR = 1.46 (95{\%} confidence interval, 95{\%} CI = 1.02-2.09)). When stratifying according to combined 'GSTM1 genotype-meat consumption' categories, breast cancer risk is slightly increased with consumption of red meat both in women with genotype GSTM1 presence (OR = 1.49 and 1.75 for intermediate and high versus low consumption) and in GSTM1 null genotype (OR = 1.18 and 1.02). These increases are statistically not significant. In postmenopausal women a suggestion of an effect of red meat consumption is observed: effects are slightly stronger, although still not statistically significant and without a clear dose-response relation: OR = 1.79 (95{\%} CI = 0.92-3.50) and 1.46 (1.46 (95{\%} CI = 0.76-2.82) for intermediate and high compared to low red meat consumption respectively. Reliable evaluation of interaction is not possible due to the small number of cancers. CONCLUSION: GSTM1 null genotype increases breast cancer risk. Red meat consumption slightly increases breast cancer risk, but the relation is not statistically significant and GSTM1, NAT1, NAT2 and GSTT1 polymorphisms do not modify this relation.},

abstract = {For genomewide association (GWA) studies in family-based designs, we propose a novel two-stage strategy that weighs the association P values with the use of independently estimated weights. The association information contained in the family sample is partitioned into two orthogonal components—namely, the between-family information and the within-family information. The between-family component is used in the first (i.e., screening) stage to obtain a relative ranking of all the markers. The within-family component is used in the second (i.e., testing) stage in the framework of the standard family-based association test, and the resulting P values are weighted using the estimated marker ranking from the screening step. The approach is appealing, in that it ensures that all the markers are tested in the testing step and, at the same time, also uses information from the screening step. Through simulation studies, we show that testing all the markers is more powerful than testing only the most promising ones from the screening step, which was the method suggested by Van Steen et al. A comparison with a population-based approach shows that the approach achieves comparable power. In the presence of a reasonable level of population stratification, our approach is only slightly affected in terms of power and, since it is a family-based method, is completely robust to spurious effects. An application to a 100K scan in the Framingham Heart Study illustrates the practical advantages of our approach. The proposed method is of general applicability; it extends to any setting in which prior, independent ranking of hypotheses is available.},

abstract = {Various metals produced from human activity are ubiquitously detected in ambient air. The metals may lead to induction and/or exacerbation of respiratory diseases, but the significant metals and factors contributing to such diseases have not been identified. To compare the effects of each metal and different oxidation states of metals on human airway, we examined the viability and production of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 using BEAS-2B cell line, derived from human airway epithelial cells. Airway epithelial cells were exposed to Mn2+, V4+, V5+, Cr3+, Cr6+, Zn2+, Ni2+, and Pb2+ at a concentration of 0.5, 5, 50, or 500 $\mu$mol/L for 24 hours. Mn and V decreased the cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner, and V5+ tended to have a greater effect than V4+. The Cr decreased the cell viability, and (Cr+6) at concentrations of 50 and 500 $\mu$mol/L was more toxic than (Cr+3). Zn at a concentration of 500 $\mu$mol/L greatly decreased the cell viability, whereas Ni at the same concentration increased it. Pb produced fewer changes. Mn and Ni at a concentration of 500 $\mu$mol/L induced the significant production of IL-6 and IL-8. However, most of the metals including (V+4, V+5), (Cr+3, Cr+6), Zn, and Pb inhibited the production of both IL-6 and IL-8. The present results indicate that various heavy metals have different effects on toxicity and the proinflammatory responses of airway epithelial cells, and those influences also depend on the oxidation states of the metals. },

abstract = {Telomerase activity (TA) and the expression of its enzymatic subunits, which have been demonstrated in many tumors, remain poorly investigated in tumors associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). In this study, we analysed the association of TA and the expression of telomerase RNA (TR) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) in 23 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) (17 high grade and 6 low grade tumors), 11 plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) and 6 dermal neurofibro- mas (DNF). TA was studied using telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay and expression of TR and TERT was investigated using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR. TA was detected in 14 out of 17 (82{\%}) high grade MPNST, whereas all 6 low grade MPNSTand 17 benign tumors were telomerase negative. The TERT transcripts were detected in all high grade MPNST, 50{\%} of the low grade MPNST, and 4 benign tumors. However, the expression level of the TERT strik- ingly correlated with TA and high grade MPNST. Thus, while TERTexpression was similar in both low grade MPNSTand PNF (P 5 0.115), it was significantly higher in high grade MPNSTwhen compared to either low grade MPNST (P 5 0.042), PNF (P 5 0.001) or DNF tumors (P 5 0.010). These findings indicate that TA and expression level of TERTare potential markers for high grade malignancy in NF1 patients.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The incidence of breast cancer varies among women living in the Southwestern part of the US. We evaluate how body size influences breast cancer risk among these women. METHODS: Cases (n = 2,325) diagnosed with breast cancer between October 1, 1999 and May 2004 residing in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, or Utah were matched to controls (n = 2,525). Participants were interviewed; height, weight, waist, and hip circumference were measured at the time of interview; blood was drawn. RESULTS: A large body mass index (BMI) at age 15 was inversely associated with pre-menopausal breast cancer risk in both non-Hispanic white (NHW) and Hispanic women (Odds ratio, ORs 0.68 95{\%} CI 0.44, 1.04, and 0.65 95{\%} CI 0.39, 1.08, respectively); BMI at age 15 also had an impact on subsequent breast cancer associated with obesity after menopause. Among post-menopausal women, recent exposure to hormones was an important modifier of risk associated with body size. Among women not recently exposed to hormones risk associated with obesity was 1.61 (95{\%} CI 1.05, 2.45) for NHW women; gaining {\textgreater} or = 25 kg between 15 and age 50 was inversely associated with breast cancer among Hispanic women (OR 0.51, 95{\%} CI 0.23, 1.14). A large weight gain and a large waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was associated with an increased odds of having an estrogen receptor negative tumor among NHW only (OR 1.81, 95{\%} CI 1.07, 3.08, and 2.04 95{\%} CI 1.20,3.50). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the metabolic consequences of obesity on breast cancer risk differ between NHW and Hispanic women living in the Southwest.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Excess body weight, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption and certain dietary factors are individually related to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk; however, little is known about their joint effects. The aim of this study was to develop a healthy lifestyle index (HLI) composed of five potentially modifiable lifestyle factors--healthy weight, physical activity, non-smoking, limited alcohol consumption and a healthy diet, and to explore the association of this index with CRC incidence using data collected within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In the EPIC cohort, a total of 347,237 men and women, 25- to 70-years old, provided dietary and lifestyle information at study baseline (1992 to 2000). Over a median follow-up time of 12 years, 3,759 incident CRC cases were identified. The association between a HLI and CRC risk was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models and population attributable risks (PARs) have been calculated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: After accounting for study centre, age, sex and education, compared with 0 or 1 healthy lifestyle factors, the hazard ratio (HR) for CRC was 0.87 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.44 to 0.77) for two factors, 0.79 (95{\%} CI: 0.70 to 0.89) for three factors, 0.66 (95{\%} CI: 0.58 to 0.75) for four factors and 0.63 (95{\%} CI: 0.54 to 0.74) for five factors; P-trend{\textless}0.0001. The associations were present for both colon and rectal cancers, HRs, 0.61 (95{\%} CI: 0.50 to 0.74; P for trend{\textless}0.0001) for colon cancer and 0.68 (95{\%} CI: 0.53 to 0.88; P-trend{\textless}0.0001) for rectal cancer, respectively (P-difference by cancer sub-site=0.10). Overall, 16{\%} of the new CRC cases (22{\%} in men and 11{\%} in women) were attributable to not adhering to a combination of all five healthy lifestyle behaviours included in the index.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Combined lifestyle factors are associated with a lower incidence of CRC in European populations characterized by western lifestyles.

abstract = {Accumulating epidemiologic evidence indicates that high consumption of red meat and of processed meat may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. We quantitatively assessed the association between red meat and processed meat consumption and the risk of colorectal cancer in a meta-analysis of prospective studies published through March 2006. Random-effects models were used to pool study results and to assess dose-response relationships. We identified 15 prospective studies on red meat (involving 7,367 cases) and 14 prospective studies on processed meat consumption (7,903 cases). The summary relative risks (RRs) of colorectal cancer for the highest vs. the lowest intake categories were 1.28 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 1.15-1.42) for red meat and 1.20 (95{\%} CI = 1.11-1.31) for processed meat. The estimated summary RRs were 1.28 (95{\%} CI = 1.18-1.39) for an increase of 120 g/day of red meat and 1.09 (95{\%} CI = 1.05-1.13) for an increase of 30 g/day of processed meat. Consumption of red meat and processed meat was positively associated with risk of both colon and rectal cancer, although the association with red meat appeared to be stronger for rectal cancer. In 3 studies that reported results for subsites in the colon, high consumption of processed meat was associated with an increased risk of distal colon cancer but not of proximal colon cancer. The results of this meta-analysis of prospective studies support the hypothesis that high consumption of red meat and of processed meat is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {Several recent studies have identified nuclear factor-KB as a key modulator in driving inflammation to cancers. Besides this transcription factor, essential in regulating inflammation and cancer development, an inflammatory microenvironment inhabiting various inflammatory cells and a network of signaling molecules are also indispensable for the malignant progression of transformed cells, which is attributed to the mutagenic predisposition of persistent infection-fighting agents at sites of chronic inflammation. As a subverted host response to inflammation-induced tumors, the inflammatory cells and regulators may facilitate angiogenesis and promote the growth, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells. Thus far, research regarding inflammation-associated cancer development has focused on cytokines and chemokines as well as their downstream targets in linking inflammation and cancer. Moreover, other proteins with extensive roles in inflammation and cancer, such as signal transducers and activators of transcription, Nrf2, and nuclear factor of activated T cells, are also proposed to be promising targets for future studies. The elucidation of their specific effects and interactions will accelerate the development of novel therapeutic interventions against cancer development triggered by inflammation.},

Several imputation algorithms use reference panels with a larger set of genotyped markers to infer genotypes at ungenotyped marker locations. Our objective was to assess which method and reference panel was more accurate when carrying out imputation. We investigated the influence of choice of two most popular imputation methods, IMPUTE and MACH, on two reference panels from the HapMap and the 1000 Genomes Project. Our results indicated that for the HapMap, MACH consistently yielded more accurate imputation results than IMPUTE, while for the 1000 Genomes Project, IMPUTE performed slightly better. The best imputation results were achieved by IMPUTE with the combined reference panel (HapMap + 1000 Genomes Project). IMPUTE with the combined reference panel is a promising strategy for genotype imputation, which should facilitate fine-mapping for discovery as well as known disease-associated candidate regions.},

The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The diversity among Hispanics/Latinos, defined by geographic origin (e.g., Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba), has been neglected when assessing cancer morbidity. For the first time in the United States, we estimated cancer rates for Cubans, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and other Latinos, and analyzed changes in cancer risk between Hispanics in their countries of origin, U.S. Hispanics in Florida, and non-Hispanic Whites in Florida. METHODS: Florida cancer registry (1999-2001) and the 2000 U.S. Census population data were used. The Hispanic Origin Identification Algorithm was applied to establish Hispanic ethnicity and subpopulation. RESULTS: The cancer rate of 537/100,000 person-years (95{\%} confidence interval, 522.5-552.5) for Hispanic males in Florida was lower than Whites (601; 595.4-606.9). Among women, these rates were 376 (365.6-387.1) and 460 (455.6-465.4), respectively. Among Florida Hispanics, Puerto Ricans had the highest rates, followed by Cubans. Mexicans had the lowest rates. Rates for Hispanics in Florida were at least 40{\%} higher than Hispanics in their countries of origin, as reported by the IARC. CONCLUSION: Substantial variability in cancer rates occurs among Hispanic subpopulations. Cubans, unlike other Hispanics, were comparable with Whites, especially for low rates of cervical and stomach cancers. Despite being overwhelmingly first generation in the U.S. mainland, Puerto Ricans and Cubans in Florida showed rates of colorectal, endometrial, and prostate cancers similar to Whites in Florida. Because rates are markedly lower in their countries of origin, the increased risk for cancer among Cubans, Mexicans, and Puerto Ricans who move to the United States should be further studied.},

abstract = {The end products of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) peroxidation, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), and isoprostanes (8-iso-PGF{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2$\alpha${\textless}/inf{\textgreater}), are widely used as systemic lipid oxidation/oxidative stress biomarkers. However, some of these compounds have also a dietary origin. Thus, replacing dietary saturated fat by PUFAs would improve health but could also increase the formation of such compounds, especially in the case of a pro-oxidant/antioxidant imbalanced diet. Hence, the possible impact of dietary fatty acids and pro-oxidant compounds was studied in rats given diets allowing comparison of the effects of heme iron vs. ferric citrate and of $\omega$-6- vs. $\omega$-3-rich oil on the level of lipid peroxidation/oxidative stress biomarkers. Rats given a heme iron-rich diet without PUFA were used as controls. The results obtained have shown that MDA and the major urinary metabolite of HNE (the mercapturic acid of dihydroxynonane, DHN-MA) were highly dependent on the dietary factors tested, while 8-iso-PGF{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2$\alpha${\textless}/inf{\textgreater} was modestly but significantly affected. Intestinal inflammation and tissue fatty acid composition were checked in parallel and could only explain the differences we observed to a limited extent. Thus, the differences in biomarkers were attributed to the formation of lipid oxidation compounds in food or during digestion, their intestinal absorption, and their excretion into urine. Moreover, fecal extracts from the rats fed the heme iron or fish oil diets were highly toxic for immortalized mouse colon cells. Such toxicity can eventually lead to promotion of colorectal carcinogenesis, supporting the epidemiological findings between red meat intake and colorectal cancer risk. Therefore, the analysis of these biomarkers of lipid peroxidation/oxidative stress in urine should be used with caution when dietary factors are not well controlled, while control of their possible dietary intake is needed also because of their pro-inflammatory, toxic, and even cocarcinogenic effects.},

abstract = {Cyclic AMP regulates a vast number of distinct events in all cells. Early studies established that its hydrolysis by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) controlled both the magnitude and the duration of its influence. Recent evidence shows that PDEs also act as coincident detectors linking cyclic-nucleotide- and non-cyclic-nucleotide-based cellular signaling processes and are tethered with great selectively to defined intracellular structures, thereby integrating and spatially restricting their cellular effects in time and space. Although 11 distinct families of PDEs have been defined, and cells invariably express numerous individual PDE enzymes, a large measure of our increased appreciation of the roles of these enzymes in regulating cyclic nucleotide signaling has come from studies on the PDE4 family. Four PDE4 genes encode more than 20 isoforms. Alternative mRNA splicing and the use of different promoters allows cells the possibility of expressing numerous PDE4 enzymes, each with unique amino-terminal-targeting and/or regulatory sequences. Dominant negative and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown strategies have proven that particular isoforms can uniquely control specific cellular functions. Thus the protein kinase A phosphorylation status of the beta(2) adrenoceptor and, thereby, its ability to switch its signaling to extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation, is uniquely regulated by PDE4D5 in cardiomyocytes. We describe how cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells selectively vary both the expression and the catalytic activities of PDE4 isoforms to regulate their various functions and how altered regulation of these processes can influence the development, or resolution, of cardiovascular pathologies, such as heart failure, as well as various vasculopathies.},

abstract = {An increasing number of genome-wide association (GWA) studies are now using the higher resolution 1000 Genomes Project reference panel (1000G) for imputation, with the expectation that 1000G imputation will lead to the discovery of additional associated loci when compared to HapMap imputation. In order to assess the improvement of 1000G over HapMap imputation in identifying associated loci, we compared the results of GWA studies of circulating fibrinogen based on the two reference panels. Using both HapMap and 1000G imputation we performed a meta-analysis of 22 studies comprising the same 91,953 individuals. We identified six additional signals using 1000G imputation, while 29 loci were associated using both HapMap and 1000G imputation. One locus identified using HapMap imputation was not significant using 1000G imputation. The genome-wide significance threshold of 5×10-8 is based on the number of independent statistical tests using HapMap imputation, and 1000G imputation may lead to further independent tests that should be corrected for. When using a stricter Bonferroni correction for the 1000G GWA study (P-value {\textless} 2.5×10-8), the number of loci significant only using HapMap imputation increased to 4 while the number of loci significant only using 1000G decreased to 5. In conclusion, 1000G imputation enabled the identification of 20{\%} more loci than HapMap imputation, although the advantage of 1000G imputation became less clear when a stricter Bonferroni correction was used. More generally, our results provide insights that are applicable to the implementation of other dense reference panels that are under development.},

abstract = {Substantial experimental evidence indicates that the hormonal form of vitamin D promotes the differentiation and inhibits the proliferation, invasiveness, and metastasis of human prostatic cancer cells. Results from epidemiologic studies of vitamin D status and/or vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk have been mixed. We conducted a population-based, case-control study of advanced prostate cancer among men ages 40 to 79 years from the San Francisco Bay area. Interview data on lifetime sun exposure and other risk factors were collected for 905 non-Hispanic White men (450 cases and 455 controls). Using a reflectometer, we measured constitutive skin pigmentation on the upper underarm (a sun-protected site) and facultative pigmentation on the forehead (a sun-exposed site) and calculated a sun exposure index from these measurements. Biospecimens were collected for 426 cases and 440 controls. Genotyping was done for VDR polymorphisms in the 5' regulatory region (Cdx-2), exon 2 (FokI), and the 3' region (TaqI and BglI). Reduced risk of advanced prostate cancer was associated with high sun exposure determined by reflectometry [odds ratio (OR), 0.51; 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI), 0.33-0.80] and high occupational outdoor activity (OR, 0.73; 95{\%} CI, 0.48-1.11). Significant risk reductions with the high-activity alleles FokI FF or Ff, TaqI tt, and BglI BB genotypes and a nonsignificant reduction with Cdx-2 AG or AA genotype were observed in the presence of high sun exposure, with ORs ranging from 0.46 to 0.67. Our findings support the hypothesis that sun exposure and VDR polymorphisms together play important roles in the etiology of prostate cancer.},

A GxE occurs when the effect of exposure to an environmental pathogen on health is conditional on a person's genotype (or conversely, when environmental experience moderates genes' effects on health). Gene-environment interactions were thought to be rare in psychiatry, but empirical findings of measured GxEs are now emerging. However, the current high level of curiosity about GxE is accompanied by uncertainty about the feasibility of GxE research and by pragmatic questions about how to carry out good GxE studies. First, we summarize emerging evidence about GxE in psychiatric disorders. Second, we describe 7 strategic steps that may be used to organize further hypothesis-driven studies of GxE. Third, we explain the potential benefits of the measured-GxE approach for basic neuroscience and for gene hunting. We suggest that in psychiatric genetics, ignoring nurture handicaps the field's capacity to make new discoveries about nature.},

Methods The study identiﬁed 19,283 cases of TNBC and 89,089 of ER?/PR?/HER2- from the California Cancer Registry. Logistic regression analyses were conducted separately for whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asian/Paciﬁc Islanders (API) to compute the adjusted odds ratios (OR) for age and SES for the TNBC versus the ER?/PR?/ HER2- subtype.
Results White (OR=1.37;1.23-1.53) and Hispanic and women (OR=1.35;1.17-1.56) 30–39 had increased odds of the TNBC when compared with women 50–59 of the same race/ethnicity. Black women under 40 had the same odds, and black women 40–49 had lower odds of the TNBC as black women 50–59. White, black, and Hispanic women 70 and older had decreased or the same odds of the TNBC as 50 to 59-year-old women. API women had a similar risk of TNBC at all ages. Lower SES was associated with increased risk of TNBC only for white and Hispanic women. The odds of TNBC were no worse for API women with lower SES than API women with higher SES. SES was not statistically signiﬁcant for black women.
Conclusions When assessing the odds of TNBC within a single race/ethnicity, young age and low SES are risk},

abstract = {The PTEN protein is a lipid phosphatase with putative tumor suppressing abilities, including inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Inactivating mutations or deletions of the PTEN gene, which result in hyper-activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, are increasingly being reported in human malignancies, including breast cancer, and have been related to features of poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy and hormone therapy. Prior studies in different tumor models have shown that, under conditions of PTEN deficiency, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway becomes a fundamental proliferative and survival pathway, and that pharmacological inhibition of this pathway results in tumor growth inhibition. This study aimed to explore further this hypothesis in breast cancer cells. To this end, we have determined the growth response to inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in a series of breast cancer cell lines with different PTEN levels. The PTEN-negative cell line displayed greater sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 and rapamycin, an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt downstream mediator mTOR, compared with the PTEN-positive cell lines. To determine whether or not these differences in response are specifically due to effects of PTEN, we developed a series of cell lines with reduced PTEN protein expression compared with the parental cell line. These reduced PTEN cells demonstrated an increased sensitivity to the anti-proliferative effects induced by LY294002 and rapamycin compared with the parental cells, which corresponded to alterations in cell cycle response. These findings indicate that inhibitors of mTOR, some of which are already in clinical development (CCI-779, an ester of rapamycin), have the potential to be effective in the treatment of breast cancer patients with PTEN-negative tumors and should be evaluated in this setting.},

abstract = {Xanthines like theophylline have long been recognised as being effective drugs for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). They are of interest as they possess both anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator activity in the same molecule. Since the discovery of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in the late 1950s, it has been suggested that xanthines work, in part, by acting as non-selective PDE inhibitors. However, it has also been suggested that the ability of xanthines to non-selectively inhibit PDEs contributes to their many unwanted side effects, thus limiting their use since the arrival of inhaled drugs with more favourable safety profiles. As our understanding of PDEs has improved over the last 30 years, and with the recognition that the distribution of different PDEs varies across different cell types, this family of enzymes has been widely investigated as targets for novel drugs. In particular, PDE3 in airway smooth muscle and PDE4 and PDE7 in inflammatory cells have been targeted to provide new bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents, respectively. This review discusses the progress made in this field over the last decade in the development of selective PDE inhibitors to treat COPD and asthma.},

A nested case-control study was conducted among 24 697 postmenopausal women included in the 'Diet, Cancer and Health' cohort study (1993-2000). Three hundred and seventy-eight breast cancer cases were identified and matched to 378 controls. The incidence rate ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) for breast cancer was 1.09 (1.02-1.17) for total meat, 1.15 (1.01-1.31) for red meat and 1.23 (1.04-1.45) for processed meat per 25 g daily increment in intake.

Interaction analyses revealed that the positive associations between total meat intake and red meat intake and breast cancer risk were confined to intermediate/fast N-acetyl transferase 2 acetylators (Pinteraction = 0.03 and 0.04). Our findings support an association between meat consumption and breast cancer risk and that N-acetyl transferase 2 polymorphism has a modifying effect on the association, indicating that the association is confined to only genetically susceptible women.},

abstract = {Background: This study evaluated the risk factors associated with racial disparities in female breast cancer mortality for African-American and Hispanic women at the census tract level in Texas from 1995 to 2005. Methods: Data on female breast cancer cases were obtained from the Texas Cancer Registry. Socioeconomic and demographic data were collected from Census 2000. Network distance and driving times to mammography facilities were estimated using Geographic Information System techniques. Demographic, poverty and spatial accessibility factors were constructed using principal component analysis. Logistic regression models were developed to predict the census tracts with significant racial disparities in breast cancer mortality based on racial disparities in late-stage diagnosis and structured factors from the principal component analysis. Results: Late-stage diagnosis, poverty factors, and demographic factors were found to be significant predictors of a census tract showing significant racial disparities in breast cancer mortality. Census tracts with higher poverty status were more likely to display significant racial disparities in breast cancer mortality for both African Americans (odds ratio [OR], 2.43; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.95-3.04) and Hispanics (OR, 5.30; 95{\%} CI, 4.26-6.59). Spatial accessibility was not a consistent predictor of racial disparities in breast cancer mortality for African-American and Hispanic women. Conclusion: Physical access to mammography facilities does not necessarily reflect a greater utilization of mammogram screening, possibly owing to financial constraints. Therefore, a metric measuring access to health care facilities is needed to capture all aspects of access to preventive care. Despite easier physical access to mammography facilities in metropolitan areas, great resources and efforts should also be devoted to these areas where racial disparities in breast cancer mortality are often found. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

The immune system also helps the host eliminate toxic or allergenic substances that enter through mucosal surfaces. Central to the immune system's ability to mobilize a response to an invading pathogen, toxin, or allergen is its ability to distinguish self from nonself. The host uses both innate and adaptive mechanisms to detect and eliminate pathogenic microbes, and both of these mechanisms include self-nonself discrimination. This overview identifies key mechanisms used by the immune system to respond to invading microbes and other exogenous threats and identifies settings in which disturbed immune function exacerbates tissue injury. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma {\&} Immunology.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The potential influence of dietary factors on inflammation is important for cancer prevention. Utilizing data from control participants (312 men, 911 women) in 2 nested case-control studies of cancer within the Multiethnic Cohort, we examined the associations of red and processed meat intake with serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$, and interleukin (IL)-6 and the mediator effect of body mass index (BMI) on the above associations (if present). METHODS Multivariable linear models were applied to assess the association between red and processed meat intake at cohort entry and serum biomarker levels measured 9.1 years later after adjusting for covariates and to determine the mediator effect of BMI. RESULTS Overall red and processed meat intake was positively associated with serum leptin levels in men ($\beta$ = 0.180, p = 0.0004) and women ($\beta$ = 0.167, p {\textless} 0.0001). In women, higher red and processed meat consumption was significantly associated with higher CRP ($\beta$ = 0.069, p = 0.03) and lower adiponectin levels ($\beta$ = -0.082, p = 0.005). In mediation analyses with red and processed meat intake and BMI as predictors, the associations of red and processed meat with biomarkers decreased substantially (as indicated by percentage change in effect: leptin in men, 13.4{\%}; leptin in women, 13.7{\%}; adiponectin in women, -4.7{\%}; CRP in women, 7.4{\%}) and were no longer significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05), whereas BMI remained significantly associated with serum leptin (men: $\beta$ = 3.209, p {\textless} 0.0001; women: $\beta$ = 2.891, p {\textless} 0.0001), adiponectin (women: $\beta$ = -1.085, p {\textless} 0.0001), and CRP (women: $\beta$ = 1.581, p {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSION The current data suggest that the amount of excess body weight or the degree of adiposity may mediate the relations between dietary red and processed meat intake and serum biomarkers associated with obesity and inflammation.},

abstract = {Research on the relation between phytoestrogens and breast cancer risk has been limited in scope. Most epidemiologic studies have involved Asian women and have examined the effects of traditional soy foods (e.g., tofu), soy protein, or urinary excretion of phytoestrogens. The present study extends this research by examining the effects of a spectrum of phytoestrogenic compounds on breast cancer risk in non-Asian US women. African-American, Latina, and White women aged 35-79 years, who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1995 and 1998, were compared with women selected from the general population via random digit dialing. Interviews were conducted with 1,326 cases and 1,657 controls. Usual intake of specific phytoestrogenic compounds was assessed via a food frequency questionnaire and a newly developed nutrient database. Phytoestrogen intake was not associated with breast cancer risk (odds ratio = 1.0, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.80, 1.3 for the highest vs. lowest quartile). Results were similar for pre- and postmenopausal women, for women in each ethnic group, and for all seven phytoestrogenic compounds studied. Phytoestrogens appear to have little effect on breast cancer risk at the levels commonly consumed by non-Asian US women: an average intake equivalent to less than one serving of tofu per week.},

abstract = {This case-control study examined different food groups in relation to breast cancer. Between 2002 and 2004, 437 cases and 922 controls matched according to age and area of residence were interviewed. Diet was measured by a validated food frequency questionnaire. Adjusted odds ratios (Ors) were computed across levels of various dietary intakes identified by two methods: the "classical" and the "spline" methods. Neither of the 2 methods found an association between total fruit and vegetable consumption and breast cancer. Results of the 2 methods showed a nonsignificant decreased association with cooked vegetables intake as well as legumes and fish consumption. Whereas the spline method showed no association, the classical method showed significant associations related to the lowest consumption of raw vegetables or dairy products and breast cancer risk: Adjusted OR for raw vegetable consumption between (67.4 and 101.3 g/day) vs. ({\textless} 67.4 g/day) was 0.63 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.43-0.93]. Adjusted OR for dairy consumption between (134.3 and 271.2 g/day) vs. ({\textless} 134.3 g/day) was 1.57 (95{\%} CI = 1.06-2.32). However, the overall results were not consistent. Compared to the classical method, the use of the spline method showed a significant association for cereal, meat, and olive oil. Cereal and olive oil were inversely associated with breast cancer risk. Breast cancer risk increased by 56{\%} for each additional 100 g/day of meat consumption. Studies using novel methodological techniques are needed to confirm the dietary threshold responsible for changes in breast cancer risk. New approaches that consist in analyzing dietary patterns rather than dietary food are necessary.},

abstract = {Due to the high incidence of breast cancer among US females, risk-reduction strategies are essential. Before considering approaches to breast cancer risk reduction, it is important for clinicians to complete individualized qualitative and quantitative assessments of risk for their patients in order to inform physicians' clinical decision making and management and to engage patients collaboratively in a thorough discussion of risks and benefits. This review will summarize information on potential pharmacologic, nutritional, surgical, and behavioral approaches to reducing breast cancer risk. While there is no clear evidence that specific dietary components can effectively reduce breast cancer risk, weight gain and obesity in adulthood are risk factors for the development of postmenopausal breast cancer. Alcohol consumption, even at moderate levels, increases breast cancer risk, although some of the detrimental effects may be reduced by sufficient folate intake. Women at increased risk of breast cancer can opt to reduce their breast cancer risk through the use of tamoxifen or raloxifene; other chemopreventive agents remain under investigation. Surgical approaches to risk reductions are restricted to those patients with a substantially increased risk of developing breast cancer. Patients should be encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle for their overall well-being and to remain up to date with recommendations for screening and surveillance.},

These approaches typically examine whether a group of related genes in the same functional pathway are jointly associated with a trait of interest. Here we review the development of pathway-based approaches for GWA studies, discuss their practical use and caveats, and suggest that pathway-based approaches may also be useful for future GWA studies with sequencing data.},

abstract = {The availability of extensively genotyped reference samples, such as "The HapMap" and 1,000 Genomes Project reference panels, together with advances in statistical methodology, have allowed for the imputation of genotypes at single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers that are untyped in a cohort or case-control study. These imputation procedures facilitate the interpretation and meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies. A natural question when implementing these procedures concerns how best to take into account uncertainty in imputed genotypes. Here we compare the performance of the following three strategies: least-squares regression on the "best-guess" imputed genotype; regression on the expected genotype score or "dosage"; and mixture regression models that more fully incorporate posterior probabilities of genotypes at untyped SNPs. Using simulation, we considered a range of sample sizes, minor allele frequencies, and imputation accuracies to compare the performance of the different methods under various genetic models. The mixture models performed the best in the setting of a large genetic effect and low imputation accuracies. However, for most realistic settings, we find that regressing the phenotype on the estimated allelic or genotypic dosage provides an attractive compromise between accuracy and computational tractability.},

abstract = {Exposure to persistent organic pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is correlated with multiple vascular complications including endothelial cell dysfunction and atherosclerosis. PCB-induced activation of the vasculature subsequently leads to oxidative stress and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion proteins. Gene expression of these cytokines/proteins is known to be regulated by small, endogenous oligonucleotides known as microRNAs that interact with messenger RNA. MicroRNAs are an acknowledged component of the epigenome, but the role of environmentally-driven epigenetic changes such as toxicant-induced changes in microRNA profiles is currently understudied. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of PCB exposure on microRNA expression profile in primary human endothelial cells using the commercial PCB mixture Aroclor 1260. Samples were analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip{\textregistered} miRNA 4.0 arrays for high throughput detection and selected microRNA gene expression was validated (RT-PCR). Microarray analysis identified 557 out of 6658 microRNAs that were changed with PCB exposure (p {\textless} 0.05). In-silico analysis using MetaCore database identified 21 of these microRNAs to be associated with vascular diseases. Further validation showed that Aroclor 1260 increased miR-21, miR-31, miR-126, miR-221 and miR-222 expression levels. Upregulated miR-21 has been reported in cardiac injury while miR-126 and miR-31 modulate inflammation. Our results demonstrated evidence of altered microRNA expression with PCB exposure, thus providing novel insights into mechanisms of PCB toxicity.},

abstract = {Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) comprise a family of enzymes that cleave protein substrates based on a conserved mechanism involving activation of an active site-bound water molecule by a Zn(2+) ion. Although the catalytic domain of MMPs is structurally highly similar, there are many differences with respect to substrate specificity, cellular and tissue localization, membrane binding and regulation that make this a very versatile family of enzymes with a multitude of physiological functions, many of which are still not fully understood. Essentially, all members of the MMP family have been linked to disease development, notably to cancer metastasis, chronic inflammation and the ensuing tissue damage as well as to neurological disorders. This has stimulated a flurry of studies into MMP inhibitors as therapeutic agents, as well as into measuring MMP levels as diagnostic or prognostic markers. As with most protein families, deciphering the function(s) of MMPs is difficult, as they can modify many proteins. Which of these reactions are physiologically or pathophysiologically relevant is often not clear, although studies on knockout animals, human genetic and epigenetic, as well as biochemical studies using natural or synthetic inhibitors have provided insight to a great extent. In this review, we will give an overview of 23 members of the human MMP family and describe functions, linkages to disease and structural and mechanistic features. MMPs can be grouped into soluble (including matrilysins) and membrane-anchored species. We adhere to the 'MMP nomenclature' and provide the reader with reference to the many, often diverse, names for this enzyme family in the introduction.},

These studies have produced vast repositories of genetic variation and trait measurements across millions of individuals, providing tremendous opportunities for further analyses. However, privacy concerns and other logistical considerations often limit access to individual-level genetic data, motivating the development of methods that analyze summary association statistics. Here we review recent progress on statistical methods that leverage summary association data to gain insights into the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases.},

abstract = {The development of next-generation sequencing technologies has allowed researchers to study comprehensively the contribution of genetic variation particularly rare variants to complex diseases. To date many sequencing analyses of rare variants have focused on marginal genetic effects and have not explored the potential role environmental factors play in modifying genetic risk. Analysis of gene-environment interaction (GxE) for rare variants poses considerable challenges because of variant rarity and paucity of subjects who carry the variants while being exposed. To tackle this challenge, we propose a hierarchical model to jointly assess the GxE effects of a set of rare variants for example, in a gene or regulatory region, leveraging the information across the variants. Under this model, GxE is modeled by two components. The first component incorporates variant functional information as weights to calculate the weighted burden of variant alleles across variants, and then assess their GxE interaction with the environmental factor. Since this information is a priori known, this component is fixed effects in the model. The second component involves residual GxE effects that have not been accounted for by the fixed effects. In this component, the residual GxE effects are postulated to follow an unspecified distribution with mean 0 and variance [Formula: see text] We develop a novel testing procedure by deriving two independent score statistics for the fixed effects and the variance component separately. We propose two data-adaptive combination approaches for combining these two score statistics and establish the asymptotic distributions. An extensive simulation study shows that the proposed approaches maintain the correct type I error and the power is comparable to or better than existing methods under a wide range of scenarios. Finally we illustrate the proposed methods by a exome-wide GxE analysis with NSAIDs use in colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {Contemporary genetic association studies may test hundreds of thousands of genetic variants for association, often with multiple binary and continuous traits or under more than one model of inheritance. Many of these association tests may be correlated with one another because of linkage disequilibrium between nearby markers and correlation between traits and models. Permutation tests and simulation-based methods are often employed to adjust groups of correlated tests for multiple testing, since conventional methods such as Bonferroni correction are overly conservative when tests are correlated. We present here a method of computing P values adjusted for correlated tests (P-ACT) that attains the accuracy of permutation or simulation-based tests in much less computation time, and we show that our method applies to many common association tests that are based on multiple traits, markers, and genetic models. Simulation demonstrates that P-ACT attains the power of permutation testing and provides a valid adjustment for hundreds of correlated association tests. In data analyzed as part of the Finland-United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics (FUSION) study, we observe a near one-to-one relationship (r(2) {\textgreater} .999) between P-ACT and the corresponding permutation-based P values, achieving the same precision as permutation testing but thousands of times faster.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: More than 50{\%} of the colorectal cancer (CRC) etiology has been attributed to diet. Established or suspected dietary factors modifying risk of CRC are red meat, cereals, fish, and fibre. Diet and lifestyle may be linked to cancer through inflammation. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. We wanted to test if dietary factors and IL10 polymorphisms interact in relation to colorectal carcinogenesis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The functional IL10 polymorphism C-592A (rs1800872) and the marker rs3024505 were assessed in relation to diet and lifestyle in a nested case-cohort study of 378 CRC cases and 775 randomly selected participants from a prospective study of 57,053 persons. Genotyping data on the IL10 polymorphism C-592A, smoking and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) was retrieved from Vogel et al. (Mutat Res, 2007; 624:88). Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95{\%} Confidence Interval (95{\%} CI) were calculated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: No associations were found between the IL10 rs3024505 polymorphism and risk of CRC. There was interaction between rs3024505 and dietary fibre (P-value for interaction = 0.01). IL10 rs3024505 homozygous wildtype carriers were at 27{\%} reduced risk of CRC per 10 g fibre per day (95{\%} CI: 0.60-0.88) whereas variant carriers had no risk reduction by fibre intake. Also, interaction between IL10 C-592A and intake of fibre was found (P-value for interaction = 0.02). Among those eating {\textless}17.0 grams of fibre per day, carriers of an C-592A variant allele had a statistically significantly higher risk of colorectal cancer compared to homozygous wildtypes. No significant differences in colorectal cancer risk were observed between the reference group (CC and {\textless}17.0 g/day) and carriers of one C-592A variant allele eating 17.0 or more grams of dietary fibre per day. This suggests that the increased risk due to carrying the variant allele can be overcome by higher fibre intake. No interactions between IL10 polymorphisms and dietary meat, cereal, or fish intake, or between IL10 rs3024505 and smoking or NSAID use were found.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In this northern Caucasian cohort we found interaction between IL10 and dietary fibre in CRC carcinogenesis. High intake of fibre seems to protect against CRC among individuals with IL10 related genetic susceptibility to CRC. This finding should be evaluated in other prospective and population-based cohorts with different ethnic groups.},

abstract = {Recent advances in human genomics have made it possible to better understand the genetic basis of disease. In addition, genetic association studies can also elucidate the mechanisms by which "non-genetic" exogenous and endogenous exposures influence the risk of disease. This is true both of studies that assess the marginal effect of a single gene and studies that look at the joint effect of genes and environmental exposures. For example, gene variants that are known to alter enzyme function or level can serve as surrogates for long-term biomarker levels that are impractical or impossible to measure on many subjects. Evidence that genetic variants modify the effect of an established risk factor may help specify the risk factor's biologically active components. We illustrate these ideas with several examples and discuss design and analysis challenges, particularly for studies of gene-environment interaction. We argue that to increase the power to detect interaction effects and limit the number of false positive results, large sample sizes will be needed, which are currently only available through planned collaborative efforts. Such collaborations also ensure a common approach to measuring variation at a genetic locus, avoiding a problem that has led to difficulties when comparing results from genetic association studies.},

abstract = {Cancer, the second cause of mortality in the world, is continuing to be major health problem worldwide. In order to overcome draw backs of nonspecific traditional chemotherapeutic agents, identification of specific tumor targets and design of novel analogues are very important. The EGFR, a tyrosine kinase receptor is one of the most suitable targets for cancer. Agents which could inhibit EGFR are directly related to blockade of regulatory processes of cellular proliferation. Our aim was to develop novel Acetidino-quinazoline derivatives inhibiting EGFR leads to potent anticancer agents. In-silico design of novel analogues were carried out using ACD labs ChemSketch 12. 0. Molinspiration software was used to analyse ‘Lipinski Rule of Five' and drug likeness properties. Biological activity was predicted by PASS software. Preliminary docking study was carried out using GLIDE software by SCHRODINGER. Five derivatives which obeyed rule of five and having predicted antitumor activity on EGFR were synthesized by five step process. After the completion of reaction in each step, the compounds were isolated, recrystallised by using suitable solvents, purified by TLC and column chromatography. Analogues were characterized by FT-IR, H1NMR, C13NMR and Mass Spectroscopy. The Biological evaluation was done by MTT assay using human cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa). The results were compared with standard anticancer drug paclitaxel. The results of present research work showed that novel acetidino-quinazoline derivatives have comparable antiproliferative effect with that of standard anticancer drug paclitaxel. This will lead to the development of promising lead compounds for target specific anticancer therapy and encourage further optimization to develop potent antiproliferative agents. {\textcopyright} 2016, Global Research Online.

abstract = {Thyroid cancer is three times more prevalent in females but the role of sex hormones in its pathogenesis is unknown. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is crucial for angiogenesis. Its expression correlates with tumor aggressiveness and metastatic potential. We determined the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and VEGF-A in thyroid neoplasms to see if expression correlated with age and sex, histological type, cancer stage, and clinical outcome. Pathological samples of thyroid cancer diagnosed from 2002 to 2007 were stained immunohistochemically for ER, PR, and VEGF-A. Grading was done qualitatively in intensity and quantitatively in percentage. Both grades were multiplied to assign a final score. One hundred and four patients were studied, of which 82 per cent were female with a mean age of 53 years (range 23-86 years). Most tumors were papillary in origin. Overall, final scores were significantly higher for ER (1.41) and PR (1.0) in tumors compared with the ER (1.07) and PR (0.42) in normal tissue (P = 0.005 and {\textless} 0.001, respectively). Conversely, VEGF-A had lower expression in tumor tissues (7.2) than in normal tissue (8.2) (P = 0.024). No predilection was found for specific age group, gender, histological subtype, or stage of the cancer. Thus, compared with normal tissue, ER and PR expression is higher and VEGF-A expression is lower in tumor thyroid tissue. The overexpression of sex hormone receptors in thyroid tumor suggests their role in thyroid cancer pathogenesis and needs further investigation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research is limited on the independent and joint effects of individual- and neighborhood-level socioeconomic status (SES) on breast cancer survival across different racial/ethnic groups. METHODS: We studied individual-level SES, measured by self-reported education, and a composite neighborhood SES (nSES) measure in females (1,068 non-Hispanic whites, 1,670 Hispanics, 993 African-Americans, and 674 Asian-Americans), ages 18 to 79 years and diagnosed 1995 to 2008, in the San Francisco Bay Area. We evaluated all-cause and breast cancer-specific survival using stage-stratified Cox proportional hazards models with cluster adjustment for census block groups. RESULTS: In models adjusting for education and nSES, lower nSES was associated with worse all-cause survival among African-Americans (P trend = 0.03), Hispanics (P trend = 0.01), and Asian-Americans (P trend = 0.01). Education was not associated with all-cause survival. For breast cancer-specific survival, lower nSES was associated with poorer survival only among Asian-Americans (P trend = 0.01). When nSES and education were jointly considered, women with low education and low nSES had 1.4 to 2.7 times worse all-cause survival than women with high education and high nSES across all races/ethnicities. Among African-Americans and Asian-Americans, women with high education and low nSES had 1.6 to 1.9 times worse survival, respectively. For breast cancer-specific survival, joint associations were found only among Asian-Americans with worse survival for those with low nSES regardless of education. CONCLUSIONS: Both neighborhood and individual SES are associated with survival after breast cancer diagnosis, but these relationships vary by race/ethnicity. IMPACT: A better understanding of the relative contributions and interactions of SES with other factors will inform targeted interventions toward reducing long-standing disparities in breast cancer survival.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polymorphic variation at the 5p15.33 (TERT-CLPTM1L) locus is associated with the risk of many cancers but a relationship with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk has yet to be defined. METHODS: We used data from six genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of CRC, linkage disequilibrium mapping and imputation, to examine the relationship between 73 single-nucleotide polymorphisms at 5p15.33 and CRC risk in detail. RESULTS: rs2736100, which localises to intron 2 of TERT, provided the strongest evidence of an association with CRC (P=2.28 × 10⁻⁴). The association was also shown in an independent series of 10 047 CRC cases and 6918 controls (P=0.02). A meta-analysis of all seven studies (totalling 16 039 cases, 16 430 controls) provided increased evidence of association (P=2.49 × 10⁻⁵; per allele odds ratio=1.07). The association of rs2736100 on CRC risk was shown to be independent of 15 low-penetrance variants previously identified. CONCLUSION: The rs2736100 association demonstrates an influence of variation at 5p15.33 on CRC risk and further evidence that the 5p15.33 (TERT-CLPTM1L) locus has pleiotropic effects (reflecting generic or lineage-specific effects) on cancer risk.},

Email: hdavoodi1345@gmail.com Background: Gastric cancer is the fourth major malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Studies have shown that dietary components are implicated in the etiology of gastric cancer. The relationship between diet-related inflammation and the risk of gastric cancer has not been investigated. Methods: We examined the ability of DII to predict the risk of gastric cancer in a case- control study conducted from December 2014 to May 2016. This included 82 cases and 95 controls, who attended specialized centers in Tabriz, Iran. DII scores were computed based on dietary intake assessed using a validate 168-item FFQ. Logistic regression models were used to estimate multivariable ORs adjusted for age, sex, BMI, education, smoking, alcohol, H.pylori infection, physical activity, aspirin/NSAID use and total caloric intake. Results: When DII scores were analyzed both as a dichotomous variable and as a continuous variable. In the fully adjusted model, subjects with DII score {\textgreater}-1.77, compared with subjects with DII≤-1.77, had nearly 3.5 times higher odds of having gastric cancer (ORDII{\textgreater}-1.77≤-1.77=3.39; 95{\%}CI=1.59, 7.22). When DII scores were fit as a continuous variable and controlling these same factors there was {\textgreater}2.5 increased risk of gastric cancer for each DII point (OR=2.65, CI=1.73-4.07). Also, for every one-unit increase in DII, there was a corresponding increase in hsCRP, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL- 1b: $\beta$=0.09 (95{\%}CI:0.006, 0.17); 0.16 (95{\%}CI:0.05, 0.26); 0.16 (95{\%}CI:0.06, 0.27) and 0.10 (95{\%}CI:0.02, 0.19), respectively; and a corresponding decrease in IL-10: $\beta$=-0.11 (95{\%}CI: -0.21, -0.005).Conclusion: Subjects who consumed a more pro-inflammatory diet were at increased risk of gastric cancer compared to those who consumed a more anti-inflammatory diet.},

abstract = {There are limited data regarding breast cancer subtypes among Hispanic women. The current study assessed the distribution and prognosis of molecular subtypes defined by joint expression of the hormone receptors (HR; estrogen and progesterone) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Using California Cancer Registry data, we identified Hispanic women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from 2005 to 2010. Breast cancer subtypes were defined as HR+/HER2-, HR+/HER2+, HR-/HER2+, and HR-/HER2- (triple negative). We estimated breast cancer subtype frequencies and used polytomous logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier survival plots and Cox regression to examine differences in relation to demographic and clinical characteristics. Among 16,380 Hispanic women with breast cancer, HR+/HER- subtype was the most common (63 {\%}), followed by triple negative (16 {\%}), HR+/HER2+ (14 {\%}), and HR-/HER2+ (8 {\%}). Women in lower SES neighborhoods had greater risk of triple negative and HR-/HER2+ subtypes relative to HR+/HER2- (p {\textless} 0.05). Hispanic women with triple negative and HR-/HER2+ tumors experienced poorer survival than those with HR+/HER- tumors. Breast cancer-specific mortality increased with decreasing SES, relative to the highest SES quintile, from HR = 1.38 for quintile 4 to HR = 1.76 for quintile 1 (lowest SES level). Our findings indicate that Hispanic women residing in low SES neighborhoods had significantly increased risk of developing and dying from HR- than HR+ breast cancers. Similar patterns of subtype frequency and prognosis among California Hispanic women and studies of other racial/ethnic groups underscore the need to better understand the impact of SES on risk factor exposures that increase the risk of breast cancer subtypes with poor prognosis.},

abstract = {Genotype imputation is a statistical technique that is often used to increase the power and resolution of genetic association studies. Imputation methods work by using haplotype patterns in a reference panel to predict unobserved genotypes in a study dataset, and a number of approaches have been proposed for choosing subsets of reference haplotypes that will maximize accuracy in a given study population. These panel selection strategies become harder to apply and interpret as sequencing efforts like the 1000 Genomes Project produce larger and more diverse reference sets, which led us to develop an alternative framework. Our approach is built around a new approximation that uses local sequence similarity to choose a custom reference panel for each study haplotype in each region of the genome. This approximation makes it computationally efficient to use all available reference haplotypes, which allows us to bypass the panel selection step and to improve accuracy at low-frequency variants by capturing unexpected allele sharing among populations. Using data from HapMap 3, we show that our framework produces accurate results in a wide range of human populations. We also use data from the Malaria Genetic Epidemiology Network (MalariaGEN) to provide recommendations for imputation-based studies in Africa. We demonstrate that our approximation improves efficiency in large, sequence-based reference panels, and we discuss general computational strategies for modern reference datasets. Genome-wide association studies will soon be able to harness the power of thousands of reference genomes, and our work provides a practical way for investigators to use this rich information. New methodology from this study is implemented in the IMPUTE2 software package.},

abstract = {Objectives. This study compares the use of three cancer screening practices (Pap smear, mammogram, and clinical breast examination) 3 years prior to interview among five subgroups of Hispanic women, and examines whether sociodemographic; access; health behavior, perception, and knowledge; and acculturation factors predict screening practices for any subgroup. Methods. Descriptive and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted with data pooled from the 1990 and 1992 National Health Interview Surveys on women who reported that they were Hispanic. The study sample includes 2,391 respondents: 668 Mexican-American, 537 Mexican, 332 Puerto Rican, 143 Cuban, and 711 other Hispanic women. Results. Subgroup profiles reveal differences in education, health insurance, use of English language, and screening use. Mexican women were the least likely to be screened with any procedure. Logistic regression results for each screening practice show that having a usual source of care was a positive predictor for obtaining each of the three screening practices within the last 3 years. Being married, being more than 50 years of age, and having knowledge of breast self-examination were all predictors of having a Pap smear. Having health insurance and ever having had a clinical breast examination and Pap smear were predictors of having a mammography, while age, knowledge of breast self-examination, ever having had a Pap smear and mammogram, and being a nonsmoker all predicted having a clinical breast examination. Conclusions. We conclude that access factors and prior screening are more strongly associated with current screening than are language and ethnic factors. Our data confirm that a disproportionate percentage of Hispanic women are low income and at risk of being underscreened. Our findings from a nationally representative sample of Hispanics have implications for provider practices, ethnic-specific community interventions, and future development of measures and data collection approaches.},

abstract = {Although sample size calculations have become an important element in the design of research projects, such methods for studies involving current status data are scarce. Here, we propose a method for calculating power and sample size for studies using current status data. This method is based on a Weibull survival model for a two-group comparison. The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.},

This study gives an overview of available techniques for PS estimation and PS application. It also provides a way to help compare PS techniques, using the resulting measured covariate balance as the criterion for selecting between techniques. The empirical example for this study involves the potential causal relationship linking early-onset cannabis problems and subsequent negative mental health outcomes, using data from a prospective cohort study. PS techniques are described and evaluated based on their ability to balance the distributions of measured potentially confounding covariates for individuals with and without early-onset cannabis problems.

abstract = {Red meat intake has been postulated to increase the risk of breast cancer but epidemiologic studies have yielded inconsistent results. Data on meat intake in relation to hormone receptor-defined breast cancer are sparse. We examined the association of meat intake with incidence of breast cancer defined by oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status in the Swedish Mammography Cohort, a population-based cohort of 61,433 women. Dietary intake was assessed at baseline in 1987-1990 and again in 1997. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate relative risks for the association between long-term meat intake and breast cancer risk. During a mean follow-up of 17.4 years, 2952 incident cases of invasive breast cancer were ascertained. We found no association of total red meat, fresh red meat or processed meat intake with breast cancer risk. The multivariate relative risks (95{\%} confidence interval) for the highest quintile of total red meat intake (≥98 g/d) compared with the lowest quintile ({\textless}46 g/d) were 0.98 (0.86-1.12) for overall breast cancer, 1.10 (0.90-1.34) for ER+/PR+ tumours, 0.86 (0.60-1.23) for ER+/PR- tumours and 1.12 (0.70-1.79) for ER-/PR- tumours. Intake of pan-fried meat was positively associated with a risk of ER+/PR- tumours; the multivariate relative risk for the highest compared with the lowest quartile of intake was 1.45 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.03-2.03; Ptrend= 0.03). These results do not support an association between red meat intake and overall breast cancer risk but suggest that fried meat intake may increase the risk of ER+/PR- breast cancer. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The role of diet for the risk of breast cancer is of great interest as a potentially modifiable risk factor. The evidence from prospective observational studies was reviewed and summarized on selected dietary factors, gene-diet interactions, and breast cancer incidence. Dietary factors were considered that, based on their nutritional constituents, are of particular interest in the context of breast cancer: fat intake, biomarkers of fat intake, fruit and vegetable consumption, antioxidant vitamins (vitamins A, C, E, and beta-carotene), serum antioxidants, carbohydrate intake, glycemic index and glycemic load, dairy consumption (including vitamin D), consumption of soy products and isoflavones, green tea, heterocyclic amines, and adolescent diet. The PubMed database was searched for all prospective studies that relate these dietary items to the incidence of breast cancer or consider gene-diet interactions. Among the prospective epidemiologic studies conducted on diet and breast cancer incidence and gene-diet interactions and breast cancer incidence, to date there is no association that is consistent, strong, and statistically significant, with the exception of alcohol intake, overweight, and weight gain. The apparent lack of association between diet and breast cancer may reflect a true absence of association between diet and breast cancer incidence or may be due to measurement error exceeding the variation in the diet studied, lack of sufficient follow-up, and focus on an age range of low susceptibility. The risk of breast cancer can be reduced by avoidance of weight gain in adulthood and limiting the consumption of alcohol.},

Results of studies meeting inclusion criteria were summarized and meta?analyzed using STATA to generate summary measures of association across studies. Sixty?three published articles were identified from the search, and following title, abstract and full?text review, twenty?four studies met inclusion criteria. All articles calculated DII scores based on study?specific food?frequency questionnaires using methodology from the same article.

abstract = {The vast majority of genome-wide association study (GWAS) risk loci fall in non-coding regions of the genome. One possible hypothesis is that these GWAS risk loci alter the individual's disease risk through their effect on gene expression in different tissues. In order to understand the mechanisms driving a GWAS risk locus, it is helpful to determine which gene is affected in specific tissue types. For example, the relevant gene and tissue could play a role in the disease mechanism if the same variant responsible for a GWAS locus also affects gene expression. Identifying whether or not the same variant is causal in both GWASs and expression quantitative trail locus (eQTL) studies is challenging because of the uncertainty induced by linkage disequilibrium and the fact that some loci harbor multiple causal variants. However, current methods that address this problem assume that each locus contains a single causal variant. In this paper, we present eCAVIAR, a probabilistic method that has several key advantages over existing methods. First, our method can account for more than one causal variant in any given locus. Second, it can leverage summary statistics without accessing the individual genotype data. We use both simulated and real datasets to demonstrate the utility of our method. Using publicly available eQTL data on 45 different tissues, we demonstrate that eCAVIAR can prioritize likely relevant tissues and target genes for a set of glucose- and insulin-related trait loci.},

abstract = {The population attributable fraction (PAF) defines the proportion of a disease that would be prevented if the exposure to a particular risk factor was avoided. Familial risk is a known risk factor for many cancers, but an unbiased estimation of the PAF for familial risk requires a large study population to include rare cancers. PAFs and their corresponding standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for familial relative risk among first-degree relatives (FDRs) and second-degree relatives (SDRs) diagnosed with the same (concordant) invasive or in situ cancers. Calculations were based on the Swedish Family-Cancer Database considering 8,148,737 individuals. To assess environmental effects, PAFs were also calculated for concordant cancers among spouses. Almost all cancers showed a significant familial risk. The highest PAFs were found for the common cancers of the prostate (13.94{\%}), breast (7.46{\%}) and colorectum (6.78{\%}) among the FDRs. In the FDRs, the overall PAF for any concordant cancer was 4.20{\%}, but in the SDRs, it was only 0.34{\%}. The overall PAFs for in situ cancers were 0.86{\%} and 0.56{\%} for the FDRs and SDRs, respectively. The overall independent familial PAF was 5.96{\%} for the invasive and in situ cancers in the FDRs and SDRs. The cancers between spouses yielded an overall PAF of 0.14{\%}. For esophageal cancer, the risk among spouses was higher than the familial risk. Our study shows that the overall familial PAF of 5.96{\%}, although underestimated for sex-specific cancers, ranks as the third most common population burden after tobacco smoking and unhealthy diet.},

The essential features of each cancer include the presenting site of disease (topography), the histopathologic (morphology), molecular and genetic tumor profile, and the anatomic disease extent (stage). Without knowing these features, it is impossible to discuss investigation, treatment, and prognosis in cancer.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer, a commonly diagnosed cancer in the elderly, often develops slowly from benign polyps called adenoma. The gut microbiota is believed to be directly involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. The identity and functional capacity of the adenoma- or carcinoma-related gut microbe(s), however, have not been surveyed in a comprehensive manner. Here we perform a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) on stools from advanced adenoma and carcinoma patients and from healthy subjects, revealing microbial genes, strains and functions enriched in each group. An analysis of potential risk factors indicates that high intake of red meat relative to fruits and vegetables appears to associate with outgrowth of bacteria that might contribute to a more hostile gut environment. These findings suggest that faecal microbiome-based strategies may be useful for early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal adenoma or carcinoma.},

abstract = {Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) is a TNF ligand superfamily member that is essential for the formation, activation, and function of osteoclasts. RANKL functions via its cognate receptor RANK, and it is inhibited by the soluble decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG). In skeletal metastases, the ratio of RANKL to OPG is upregulated, which leads to increased osteoclast-mediated bone destruction. These changes in the bone microenvironment not only compromise the structural integrity of bone, leading to severe clinical morbidities, but have also been implicated in establishment of de novo bone metastasis and the progression of existing skeletal tumors. Evaluation of RANKL inhibitors, including the fully human anti-RANKL antibody denosumab, in patients with cancer has shown reductions in tumor-induced bone resorption activity and successful management of skeletal complications of bone metastases. RANKL also functions as a major paracrine effector of the mitogenic action of progesterone in mouse mammary epithelium, and it has a role in ovarian hormone-dependent expansion and regenerative potential of mammary stem cells. RANKL inhibition attenuates mammary tumorigenesis and pulmonary metastases in mouse models. These data suggest that the contribution of progesterone to increased mammary cancer incidence is mediated, at least in part, by RANKL-dependent changes in the mammary epithelium; RANKL also directly promotes distant metastases. In summary, the antitumor and antimetastatic effects of RANKL inhibition can occur by at least 2 distinct mechanisms, one in the bone via osteoclast-dependent effects, and the second via direct effects on the tumor cells of various origins and/or mammary epithelium.},

The UK10K Cohorts project has generated a data set of 3,781 whole genomes sequenced at low depth (average 7x), aiming to exhaustively characterize genetic variation down to 0.1{\%} minor allele frequency in the British population. Here we demonstrate the value of this resource for improving imputation accuracy at rare and low-frequency variants in both a UK and an Italian population. We show that large increases in imputation accuracy can be achieved by re-phasing WGS reference panels after initial genotype calling. We also present a method for combining WGS panels to improve variant coverage and downstream imputation accuracy, which we illustrate by integrating 7,562 WGS haplotypes from the UK10K project with 2,184 haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project. Finally, we introduce a novel approximation that maintains speed without sacrificing imputation accuracy for rare variants.},

abstract = {Mexican nationals in Mexico City and Mexican Americans in San Antonio, Tex, have  a lower adjusted prevalence of hypertension than San Antonio non-Hispanic whites, especially after adjusting for the greater obesity of San Antonio Mexican Americans. The concomitant examination of a new study from Spain may better explain the association of genetic and environmental factors with hypertension. Three population-based epidemiological studies conducted in Mexico City, Spain, and San Antonio, Tex, were available for comparisons. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure {\textgreater} or = 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure {\textgreater} or = 90 mm Hg, or the use of antihypertensive medications. The prevalence of hypertension was independently associated with age, body mass index, glucose tolerance, and alcohol consumption, with comparable degrees of relationship in all 4 populations. Relative to San Antonio non-Hispanic whites, an excess prevalence of hypertension was observed in Spaniards (odds ratio [OR], 1.53; 95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI], 1.24 to 1.90). A deficit in hypertension prevalence was statistically significant in Mexican nationals (OR, 0.67; 95{\%} CI, 0.53 to 0.85) and close to significance in San Antonio Mexican Americans (OR, 0.86; 95{\%} CI, 0.71 to 1.03). Thus, obesity, educational attainment, type 2 diabetes, glucose tolerance, and marked alcohol consumption ({\textgreater} or = 14 drinks/wk) do not fully explain the increased prevalence of hypertension in Spain and the lower prevalence of hypertension in Mexican-origin populations. Although we cannot conclude definitively that these differences are genetically driven, our results suggest no relationship between Spanish genetic admixture and the deficit in hypertension prevalence in Mexican-origin populations.},

abstract = {Recently, large scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses have boosted the number of known signals for some traits into the tens and hundreds. Typically, however, variants are only analysed one-at-a-time. This complicates the ability of fine-mapping to identify a small set of SNPs for further functional follow-up. We describe a new and scalable algorithm, joint analysis of marginal summary statistics (JAM), for the re-analysis of published marginal summary stactistics under joint multi-SNP models. The correlation is accounted for according to estimates from a reference dataset, and models and SNPs that best explain the complete joint pattern of marginal effects are highlighted via an integrated Bayesian penalized regression framework. We provide both enumerated and Reversible Jump MCMC implementations of JAM and present some comparisons of performance. In a series of realistic simulation studies, JAM demonstrated identical performance to various alternatives designed for single region settings. In multi-region settings, where the only multivariate alternative involves stepwise selection, JAM offered greater power and specificity. We also present an application to real published results from MAGIC (meta-analysis of glucose and insulin related traits consortium) - a GWAS meta-analysis of more than 15,000 people. We re-analysed several genomic regions that produced multiple significant signals with glucose levels 2 hr after oral stimulation. Through joint multivariate modelling, JAM was able to formally rule out many SNPs, and for one gene, ADCY5, suggests that an additional SNP, which transpired to be more biologically plausible, should be followed up with equal priority to the reported index.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An n-6 essential fatty acid, arachidonic acid (ARA) is converted into prostaglandin E2, which is involved in tumour extension. However, it is unclear whether dietary ARA intake leads to cancer in humans. We thus systematically evaluated available observational studies on the relationship between ARA exposure and the risk of colorectal, skin, breast, prostate, lung, and stomach cancers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We searched the PubMed database for articles published up to May 17, 2010. 126 potentially relevant articles from the initial search and 49,670 bibliographies were scrutinised to identify eligible publications by using predefined inclusion criteria. A comprehensive literature search yielded 52 eligible articles, and their reporting quality and methodological quality was assessed. Information on the strength of the association between ARA exposure and cancer risk, the dose-response relationship, and methodological limitations was collected and evaluated with respect to consistency and study design.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: For colorectal, skin, breast, and prostate cancer, 17, 3, 18, and 16 studies, respectively, were identified. We could not obtain eligible reports for lung and stomach cancer. Studies used cohort (n = 4), nested case-control (n = 12), case-control (n = 26), and cross-sectional (n = 12) designs. The number of subjects (n = 15 - 88,795), ARA exposure assessment method (dietary intake or biomarker), cancer diagnosis and patient recruitment procedure (histological diagnosis, cancer registries, or self-reported information) varied among studies. The relationship between ARA exposure and colorectal cancer was inconsistent based on ARA exposure assessment methodology (dietary intake or biomarker). Conversely, there was no strong positive association or dose-response relationship for breast or prostate cancer. There were limited numbers of studies on skin cancer to draw any conclusions from the results.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The available epidemiologic evidence is weak because of the limited number of studies and their methodological limitations, but nonetheless, the results suggest that ARA exposure is not associated with increased breast and prostate cancer risk. Further evidence from well-designed observational studies is required to confirm or refute the association between ARA exposure and risk of cancer.},

abstract = {Latinos born in the US, 36 million, comprise 65{\%} of all US Latinos. Yet their cancer experience is nearly always analyzed together with their foreign-born counterparts, 19 million, who constitute a steady influx of truly lower-risk populations from abroad. To highlight specific cancer vulnerabilities for US-born Latinos, we compare their cancer mortality to the majority non-Latino white (NLW) population, foreign-born Latinos, and non-Latino blacks. We analyzed 465,751 cancer deaths from 2008 to 2012 occurring among residents of California and Texas, the two most populous states, accounting for 47{\%} of US Latinos. This cross-sectional analysis, based on granular data obtained from death certificates on cause of death, age, race, ethnicity and birthplace, makes use of normal standardization techniques and negative binomial regression models. While Latinos overall have lower all-cancers-combined mortality rates than NLWs, these numbers were largely driven by low rates among the foreign born while mortality rates for US-born Latinos approach those of NLWs. Among Texas males, rates were 210 per 100,000 for NLWs and 166 for Latinos combined, but 201 per 100,000 for US-born Latinos and 125 for foreign-born Latinos. Compared to NLWs, US-born Latino males in California had mortality rate ratios of 2.83 (95{\%} CI: 2.52–3.18) for liver cancer, 1.44 (95{\%} CI: 1.30–1.61) for kidney cancer, and 1.25 (95{\%} CI: 1.17–1.34) for colorectal cancer (CRC). Texas results showed a similar site-specific pattern. Specific cancer patterns for US-born Latinos, who have relatively high cancer mortality, similar overall to NLWs, are masked by aggregation of all Latinos, US-born and foreign-born. While NLWs had high mortality for lung cancer, US-born Latinos had high mortality for liver, kidney and male colorectal cancers. HCV testing and reinforcement of the need for CRC screening should be a priority in this specific and understudied population. The unprecedented proximity of overall rates between NLWs and US-born Latino populations runs counter to the prevailing narrative of Latinos having significantly lower cancer risk and mortality. Birthplace data are critical in detecting meaningful differences among Latinos; these findings merit not only clinical but also public health attention.},

abstract = {In genome-wide gene–environment interaction (GxE) studies, a common strategy to improve power is to first conduct a filtering test and retain only the SNPs that pass the filtering in the subsequent GxE analyses. Inspired by two-stage tests and gene-based tests in GxE analysis, we consider the general problem of jointly testing a set of parameters when only a few are truly from the alternative hypothesis and when filtering information is available. We propose a unified set-based test that simultaneously considers filtering on individual parameters and testing on the set. We derive the exact distribution and approximate the power function of the proposed unified statistic in simplified settings, and use them to adaptively calculate the optimal filtering threshold for each set. In the context of gene-based GxE analysis, we show that although the empirical power function may be affected by many factors, the optimal filtering threshold corresponding to the peak of the power curve primarily depends on the size of the gene. We further propose a resampling algorithm to calculate P-values for each gene given the estimated optimal filtering threshold. The performance of the method is evaluated in simulation studies and illustrated via a genome-wide gene–gender interaction analysis using pancreatic cancer genome-wide association data.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women today and is the most common cancer among women. Although a number of risk factors such as genetics, family history, parity, age at first birth, and age at menarche and menopause have been established, most are difficult to modify. Diet, however, is a potentially modifiable approach for prevention and a variety of dietary patterns have been examined with respect to their role in breast cancer. One such dietary factor is red meat consumption. Red meat intake has been hypothesized to increase breast cancer risk but while both case-control and ecologic studies have supported a positive association, prospective cohort studies have been inconsistent. One explanation for this inconsistency may be related to menopausal status. We performed a meta-analysis on the association between breast cancer risk and red meat consumption in premenopausal women. A total of ten studies were identified. The summary relative risk was 1.24 (95{\%} CI 1.08-1.42). Case-control studies (N = 7) had a risk of 1.57 (95{\%} CI 1.23-1.99), while cohort studies (N = 3) had a summary relative risk of 1.11 (95{\%} CI 0.94-1.31).},

abstract = {Racial/ethnic disparities in mortality among US breast cancer patients are well documented. Our knowledge of the contribution of lifestyle factors to disease prognosis is based primarily on non-Latina Whites and is limited for Latina, African American, and Asian American women. To address this knowledge gap, the California Breast Cancer Survivorship Consortium (CBCSC) harmonized and pooled interview information (e.g., demographics, family history of breast cancer, parity, smoking, alcohol consumption) from six California-based breast cancer studies and assembled corresponding cancer registry data (clinical characteristics, mortality), resulting in 12,210 patients (6,501 non-Latina Whites, 2,060 African Americans, 2,032 Latinas, 1,505 Asian Americans, 112 other race/ethnicity) diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer between 1993 and 2007. In total, 3,047 deaths (1,570 breast cancer specific) were observed with a mean (SD) follow-up of 8.3 (3.5) years. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fit to data to estimate hazards ratios (HRs) and 95 {\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for overall and breast cancer-specific mortality. Compared with non-Latina Whites, the HR of breast cancer-specific mortality was 1.13 (95 {\%} CI 0.97-1.33) for African Americans, 0.84 (95 {\%} CI 0.70-1.00) for Latinas, and 0.60 (95 {\%} CI 0.37-0.97) for Asian Americans after adjustment for age, tumor characteristics, and select lifestyle factors. The CBCSC represents a large and racially/ethnically diverse cohort of breast cancer patients from California. This cohort will enable analyses to jointly consider a variety of clinical, lifestyle, and contextual factors in attempting to explain the long-standing disparities in breast cancer outcomes.},

abstract = {Background: Well-differentiated follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs) usually act indolently, while aggressively acting tumors are difficult to detect early enough. Estrogen receptors (ERs) have prognostic significance in many cancers. Thyroid diseases, including neoplasms, are associated with the female sex. The prognostic significance of ERs in FTCs has not been reported previously. Methods: We studied the role of ERa and ERb in 83 cases of follicular thyroid adenomas (FTA) and 43 FTC cases, including seven cases of poorly differentiated FTC, obtained from the Department of Surgery, Helsinki Uni-versity Central Hospital between 1990 and 2009. Patient follow-up was conducted until March 2011. Expression of ERa, ERb, and MIB-1/Ki-67 was investigated by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinicopatho-logical characteristics, including survival. Results: Two major observations were apparent. First, ERb expression was significantly higher in FTA than in FTC, and it was a stronger differential diagnostic marker than MIB-1/Ki-67. Second, low ERb expression correlated with poor survival in FTC. All cancer-specific deaths due to FTC were among low ERb-score patients. Conclusion: ERb is a differential marker for malignancy and could thus be used as a preoperative tool. FTC patients with a low ERb score need more thorough follow-up and may benefit from more aggressive treatment.},

abstract = {Chronic and persistent inflammation contributes to cancer development and can predispose to carcinogenesis. Infection-driven inflammations are involved in the pathogenesis of approximately 15-20{\%} of human tumors. However, even tumors that are not epidemiologically linked to pathogens are characterized by the presence of an inflammatory component in their microenvironment. Hallmarks of cancer-associated inflammation include the presence of infiltrating leukocytes, cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, lipid messengers, and matrix-degrading enzymes. Schematically, two interrelated pathways link inflammation and cancer: (1) genetic events leading to neoplastic transformation promote the construction of an inflammatory milieu; (2) tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, in particular macrophages, are prime regulators of cancer inflammation. Thus, an intrinsic pathway of inflammation (driven in tumor cells), as well as an extrinsic pathway (in tumor-infiltrating leukocytes) have been described and both contribute to tumor progression. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In order to thoroughly analyze risk factors of breast cancer (BC) in premenopausal Uruguayan women, a case-control study was carried out at the Pereira Rossell Women's Hospital, Montevideo, where 253 incident BC cases and 497 frequency-matched healthy controls were interviewed on menstrual and reproductive story, were administered a short food frequency questionnaire and undertook a series of body measurements necessary to calculate body composition and somatotype. Odds ratio (OR) coefficients were taken as estimates of relative risk derived from unconditional logistic regression. Among the classical risk factors, only the family history of BC in first degree relatives was significantly associated with risk of premenopausal BC (OR=2.20, 95{\%} CI 1.33-3.62). Interestingly, this risk factor was found to be stronger in women of ages {\textgreater}40 (OR=4.05, 95{\%} CI 2.10-7.81), late menarche (OR= 2.39, 95{\%} CI 1.18-4.85), early age for their first delivery (OR=3.02, 95{\%} CI 1.26-7.22), short time between menarche and first delivery (OR=3.22, 95{\%} CI 1.29-8.07), and with high parity (OR=4.10, 95{\%} CI 1.79-9.36), although heterogeneity was detected only for age and parity. High consumption of red meat was positively associated with the disease risk (OR=2.20, 95{\%} CI 1.35-3.60), in the same way as fried foods (OR=1.79, 95{\%} CI 1.12-2.84). Conversely, a high intake of plant foods displayed a protective effect (OR=0.41, 95{\%} CI 0.26-0.65). Except for hypertension (OR=1.55, 95{\%} CI 1.03-2.35), none of the analyzed components of metabolic syndrome were associated to BC risk. Particular increases of risk for premenopausal BC were found for family history in first degree relatives in certain subsets derived from the menstrual-reproductive history. Preventive strategies could broaden their scope if new studies confirm the present results, in view of the limited prevention measures that premenopausal BC currently has.},

Our objective was to evaluate the risk of breast cancer associated with meat and dairy food consumption and to assess whether non-dietary risk factors modify the relation.  Methods We combined the primary data from eight prospective cohort studies from North America and Western Europe with at least 200 incident breast cancer cases, assessment of usual food and nutrient intakes, and a validation study of the dietary assessment instrument. The pooled database included 351 041 women, 7379 of whom were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer during up to 15 years of follow-up.  Results We found no significant association between intakes of total meat, red meat, white meat, total dairy fluids, or total dairy solids and breast cancer risk. Categorical analyses suggested a J-shaped association for egg consumption where, compared to women who did not eat eggs, breast cancer risk was slightly decreased among women who consumed {\textless}2 eggs per week but slightly increased among women who consumed [{\textgreater}=]1 egg per day.  Conclusions We found no significant associations between intake of meat or dairy products and risk of breast cancer.

We explore the biological basis of disparities in breast cancer risk in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women by evaluating genetic variation in genes involved in inflammation, insulin and energy homeostasis in conjunction with genetic ancestry. Hispanic (2111 cases, 2597 controls) and non-Hispanic white (1481 cases, 1586 controls) women enrolled in the 4-Corner's Breast Cancer Study, the Mexico Breast Cancer Study and the San Francisco Bay Area Breast Cancer Study were included. Genetic admixture was determined from 104 ancestral informative markers that discriminate between European and Native American ancestry. Twenty-one genes in the CHIEF candidate pathway were evaluated. Higher Native American ancestry was associated with reduced risk of breast cancer (odds ratio = 0.79, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.65, 0.95) but was limited to postmenopausal women (odds ratio = 0.66, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.52, 0.85). After adjusting for genetic ancestry and multiple comparisons, four genes were significantly associated with breast cancer risk, NF$\kappa$B1, NF$\kappa$B1A, PTEN and STK11. Within admixture strata, breast cancer risk among women with low Native American ancestry was associated with IkBKB, NF$\kappa$B1, PTEN and RPS6KA2, whereas among women with high Native American ancestry, breast cancer risk was associated with IkBKB, mTOR, PDK2, PRKAA1, RPS6KA2 and TSC1. Higher Native American ancestry was associated with reduced breast cancer risk. Breast cancer risk differed by genetic ancestry along with genetic variation in genes involved in inflammation, insulin, and energy homeostasis.},

abstract = {Background Meat and dietary fiber are associated with increased and decreased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), respectively. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) regulate the intestinal immune response in a complex interplay between the mucosal epithelium and the microbiota and may therefore be important modulators of diet-induced CRC together with other inflammatory mediators. Objective Our aim was to investigate the association between functional TLR polymorphisms and risk of CRC and the interaction with dietary factors. Additionally, interactions with previously studied polymorphisms in IL10, IL1B, PTGS2, and NFKB1 were assessed in order to examine possible biological pathways in meat-induced CRC. Design A nested case-cohort study of 897 CRC cases and 1689 randomly selected participants from the Danish prospective "Diet, Cancer and Health" study encompassing 57,053 persons was performed using Cox proportional hazard models and the likelihood ratio test. Results We found associations between polymorphisms in TLR2 (P = 0.018) and TLR4 (P = 0.044) and risk of CRC per se, interactions between intake of red and processed meat (10 g/d) and polymorphisms in TLR1 (P-interaction = 0.032) and TLR10 (P-interaction = 0.026 and 0.036), and intake of cereals (50 g/d) and TLR4 (P-interaction = 0.044) in relation to risk of CRC. Intake of red and processed meat also interacted with combinations of polymorphisms in TLR1 and TLR10 and polymorphisms in NFKB1, IL10, IL1B, and PTGS2 (P-interaction; TLR1/rs4833095 × PTGS2/rs20417 = 0.021, TLR10/rs11096955 × IL10/rs3024505 = 0.047, TLR10/rs11096955 × PTGS2/rs20417 = 0.017, TLR10/rs4129009 × NFKB1/rs28362491 = 0.027, TLR10/rs4129009 × IL1B/rs4848306 = 0.020, TLR10/rs4129009 × IL1B/rs1143623 = 0.021, TLR10/rs4129009 × PTGS2/rs20417 = 0.027), whereas intake of dietary fiber (10 g/d) interacted with combinations of polymorphisms in TLR4, IL10, and PTGS2 (P-interaction; TLR4/rs1554973 × IL10/rs3024505 = 0.0012, TLR4/rs1554973 × PTGS2/rs20417 = 0.0041, TLR4/rs1554973 × PTGS2/rs5275 = 0.0064). Conclusions Our study suggests that meat intake may activate TLRs at the epithelial surface, leading to CRC via inflammation by nuclear transcription factor-$\kappa$B-initiated transcription of inflammatory genes, whereas intake of fiber may protect against CRC via TLR4-mediated secretion of interleukin-10 and cyclooxygenase-2. Our results should be replicated in other prospective cohorts with well-characterized participants. The trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03250637.},

abstract = {Case-control studies of unrelated subjects are now widely used to study the role of genetic susceptibility and gene-environment interactions in the etiology of complex diseases. Exploiting an assumption of gene-environment independence, and treating the distribution of environmental exposures as completely nonparametric, Chatterjee and Carroll recently developed an efficient retrospective maximum-likelihood method for analysis of case-control studies. In this article, we develop an extension of the retrospective maximum-likelihood approach to studies where genetic information may be missing on some study subjects. In particular, special emphasis is given to haplotype-based studies where missing data arise due to linkage-phase ambiguity of genotype data. We use a profile likelihood technique and an appropriate expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to derive a relatively simple procedure for parameter estimation, with or without a rare disease assumption, and possibly incorporating information on the marginal probability of the disease for the underlying population. We also describe two alternative robust approaches that are less sensitive to the underlying gene-environment independence and Hardy-Weinberg-equilibrium assumptions. The performance of the proposed methods is studied using simulation studies in the context of haplotype-based studies of gene-environment interactions. An application of the proposed method is illustrated using a case-control study of ovarian cancer designed to investigate the interaction between BRCA1/2 mutations and reproductive risk factors in the etiology of ovarian cancer.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies that have investigated whether dairy (mainly milk) diets are associated with prostate cancer risk have led to controversial conclusions. In addition, no existing study clearly evaluated the effects of dairy/milk diets on prostate tumor progression, which is clinically highly relevant in view of the millions of men presenting with prostate pathologies worldwide, including benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). We report here a unique interventional animal study to address this issue. We used two mouse models of fully penetrant genetically-induced prostate tumorigenesis that were investigated at the stages of benign hyperplasia (probasin-Prl mice, Pb-Prl) or pre-cancerous PIN lesions (KIMAP mice). Mice were fed high milk diets (skim or whole) for 15 to 27 weeks of time depending on the kinetics of prostate tumor development in each model. Prostate tumor progression was assessed by tissue histopathology examination, epithelial proliferation, stromal inflammation and fibrosis, tumor invasiveness potency and expression of various tumor markers relevant for each model (c-Fes, Gprc6a, activated Stat5 and p63). Our results show that high milk consumption (either skim or whole) did not promote progression of existing prostate tumors when assessed at early stages of tumorigenesis (hyperplasia and neoplasia). For some parameters, and depending on milk type, milk regimen could even exhibit slight protective effects towards prostate tumor progression by decreasing the expression of tumor-related markers like Ki-67 and Gprc6a. In conclusion, our study suggests that regular milk consumption should not be considered detrimental for patients presenting with early-stage prostate tumors.},

abstract = {Background {\&} aims Low-grade inflammation appears to play an etiological role in cognitive decline. However the association between an inflammatory dietary pattern and cognitive decline has not been investigated. We aimed to investigate dietary patterns associated with inflammation and whether such diet is associated with cognitive decline. Methods We analyzed 5083 participants (28.7{\%} women) from the Whitehall II cohort study. Diet and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) were assessed in 1991–1993 and 1997–1999. We used reduced rank regression methods to determine a dietary pattern associated with elevated IL-6. Cognitive tests were performed in 1997–1999 and repeated in 2002–2004 and 2007–2009. The association between dietary pattern and cognitive decline between ages 45 and 79 was assessed using linear mixed models. Results We identified an inflammatory dietary pattern characterized by higher intake of red meat, processed meat, peas and legumes, and fried food, and lower intake of whole grains which correlated with elevated IL-6 both in 1991–1993 and 1997–1999. A greater decline in reasoning was seen in participants in the highest tertile of adherence to the inflammatory dietary pattern (−0.37 SD; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] −0.40, −0.34) compared to those in the lowest tertile (−0.31; 95{\%} CI −0.34, −0.28) after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, occupational status, education, and total energy intake (p for interaction across tertiles = 0.01). This association remained significant after multivariable adjustment. Similarly for global cognition, the inflammatory dietary pattern was associated with faster cognitive decline after multivariable adjustment (p for interaction across tertiles = 0.04). Associations were stronger in younger participants ({\textless}56 years), reducing the possibility of reverse causation. Conclusions Our study found that a dietary pattern characterized as higher intake of red and processed meat, peas, legumes and fried food, and lower intake of whole grains was associated with higher inflammatory markers and accelerated cognitive decline at older ages. This supports the case for further research.},

For example, higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with reduced risk among women with lower NA ancestry only [BMI {\textless}25 versus {\textgreater}30: OR = 0.65 (95{\%} CI, 0.44-0.98) among U.S. Hispanics; OR = 0.53 (95{\%} CI, 0.29-0.97) among Mexicans]. The average number of risk factors among cases was inversely related to the percentage of NA ancestry.Conclusions:The lower NA ancestry groups were more likely to have the established risk factors, with the exception of BMI. Although the majority of factors were associated with risk in the expected directions among all women, BMI had an inverse association among Hispanics with lower NA ancestry.Impact:These data suggest that the established risk factors are less relevant for breast cancer development among women with more NA ancestry.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(5); 692-701. {\textcopyright}2016 AACR.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Ecologic, migrant, and secular trend studies suggest an association between the Western diet and the risk of breast cancer. We examined data from the Nurses Health Study II to evaluate the association between major dietary patterns and the risk of breast cancer among pre-menopausal women. METHODS: We derived "Western" and "prudent" dietary patterns from the responses of 90,638 premenopausal women, aged 26 to 46 years at baseline in 1991, who completed validated food frequency questionnaires in 1991 and 1995. These patterns were then evaluated for their associations with risk of breast cancer. RESULTS: During 8 years of follow-up, we documented 710 cases of invasive breast cancer. The multivariate RR (95{\%} CI) comparing highest to lowest quintiles of cumulative average score were 0.90 (0.68-1.18, p-value, test for trend = 0.54) for the prudent dietary pattern and 0.97 (0.71-1.33, p-value, test for trend = 0.97) for the Western dietary pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there is no overall association between dietary patterns and risk of breast cancer. However, we found an inverse association between the prudent dietary pattern and breast cancer risk among ever smokers, but the test for interaction was not significant. We suggest that this finding merits further evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Greater consumption of red and processed meat has been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer in several recent meta-analyses. Heterocyclic amines (HCAs) have been hypothesized to underlie this association. In this prospective analysis conducted within the Multiethnic Cohort Study, we examined whether greater consumption of total, red or processed meat was associated with the risk of colorectal cancer among 165,717 participants who completed a detailed food frequency questionnaire at baseline. In addition, we examined whether greater estimated intake of HCAs was associated with the risk of colorectal cancer among 131,763 participants who completed a follow-up questionnaire that included a meat-cooking module. A total of 3,404 and 1,757 invasive colorectal cancers were identified from baseline to the end of follow-up and from the date of administration of the meat-cooking module to the end of follow-up, respectively. Proportional hazard models were used to estimate basic and multivariable-adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals for colorectal cancer associated with dietary exposures. In multivariable models, no association with the risk of colorectal cancer was detected for density-adjusted total meat (RR(Q5 vs. Q1) = 0.93 [0.83-1.05]), red meat (RR = 1.02 [0.91-1.16]) or processed meat intake (RR = 1.06 [0.94-1.19]) or for total (RR = 0.90 [0.76-1.05]) or specific HCA intake whether comparing quintiles of dietary exposure or using continuous variables. Although our results do not support a role for meat or for HCAs from meat in the etiology of colorectal cancer, we cannot rule out the possibility of a modest effect.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: For men and women, taller height is associated with increased risk of all cancers combined. For colorectal cancer (CRC), it is unclear whether the differential association of height by sex is real or is due to confounding or bias inherent in observational studies. We performed a Mendelian randomization study to examine the association between height and CRC risk. METHODS: To minimize confounding and bias, we derived a weighted genetic risk score predicting height (using 696 genetic variants associated with height) in 10,226 CRC cases and 10,286 controls. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI) for associations between height, genetically predicted height and CRC. RESULTS: Using conventional methods, increased height (per 10-cm increment) was associated with increased CRC risk (OR = 1.08, 95{\%} CI = 1.02-1.15). In sex-specific analyses, height was associated with CRC risk for women (OR = 1.15, 95{\%} CI = 1.05-1.26), but not men (OR = 0.98, 95{\%} CI = 0.92-1.05). Consistent with these results, carrying greater numbers of (weighted) height-increasing alleles (per 1-unit increase) was associated with higher CRC risk for women and men combined (OR = 1.07, 95{\%} CI = 1.01-1.14) and for women (OR = 1.09, 95{\%} CI = .01-1.19). There was weaker evidence of an association for men (OR = 1.05, 95{\%} CI = 0.96-1.15). CONCLUSION: We provide evidence for a causal association between height and CRC for women. The CRC-height association for men remains unclear and warrants further investigation in other large studies.},

abstract = {Dietary guidelines advise consumers to limit intake of red meat and choose lean protein sources, such as poultry and fish. Poultry consumption has been steadily increasing in the United States, but the effect on cancer risk remains unclear. In a large U.S. cohort, we prospectively investigated poultry and fish intake and cancer risk across a range of malignancies in men and women. Diet was assessed at baseline (1995–1996) with a food frequency questionnaire in 492,186 participants of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. Over a mean follow-up of 9 years, we identified 74,418 incident cancer cases. In multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models, we estimated the substitution and addition effects of white meat (poultry and fish) intake in relation to cancer risk. In substitution models with total meat intake held constant, a 10-g (per 1,000 kcal) increase in white meat intake offset by an equal decrease in red meat intake was associated with a statistically significant reduced (3{\%}–20{\%}) risk of cancers of the esophagus, liver, colon, rectum, anus, lung, and pleura. In addition models with red meat intake held constant, poultry intake remained inversely associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, liver cancer, and lung cancer, but we observed mixed findings for fish intake. As the dietary recommendations intend, the inverse association observed between white meat intake and cancer risk may be largely due to the substitution of red meat. Simply increasing fish or poultry intake, without reducing red meat intake, may be less beneficial for cancer prevention. Cancer Prev Res; 4(11); 1903–11. {\textcopyright}2011 AACR.},

abstract = {Genetic association studies in admixed populations may be biased if individual ancestry varies within the population and the phenotype of interest is associated with ancestry. However, recently admixed populations also offer potential benefits in association studies since markers informative for ancestry may be in linkage disequilibrium across large distances. In particular, the enhanced LD in admixed populations may be used to identify alleles that underlie a genetically determined difference in a phenotype between two ancestral populations. Asthma is known to have different prevalence and severity among ancestrally distinct populations. We investigated several asthma-related phenotypes in two ancestrally admixed populations: Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans. We used ancestry informative markers to estimate the individual ancestry of 181 Mexican American asthmatics and 181 Puerto Rican asthmatics and tested whether individual ancestry is associated with any of these phenotypes independently of known environmental factors. We found an association between higher European ancestry and more severe asthma as measured by both forced expiratory volume at 1 second (r=-0.21, p=0.005) and by a clinical assessment of severity among Mexican Americans (OR: 1.55; 95{\%} CI 1.25 to 1.93). We found no significant associations between ancestry and severity or drug responsiveness among Puerto Ricans. These results suggest that asthma severity may be influenced by genetic factors differentiating Europeans and Native Americans in Mexican Americans, although differing results for Puerto Ricans require further investigation.},

abstract = {Background and Aims: The rs2981582 single nucleotide polymorphism in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene has been consistently associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. We evaluated the effect of rs2981582 polymorphism in the FGFR2 gene on the risk of breast cancer and its interaction with non-genetic risk factors. Methods: A population-based case-control study was conducted in Mexico. Data from 687 cases and 907 controls were analyzed. Results: The T allele of the rs2981582 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (ORper allele= 1.24, 95{\%} CI 1.06-1.46). There was also an interaction between this polymorphism and alcohol consumption (p= 0.043). The effect of alcohol consumption on the risk of breast cancer varied according to the allelic variants of the rs2981582 polymorphism in the FGFR2 gene: OR= 3.97 (95{\%} CI 2.10-7.49), OR= 2.01 (95{\%} CI 1.23-3.29) and OR= 1.21 (95{\%} CI 0.48-3.05) for genotypes CC, CT and TT, respectively. Conclusions: This is the first study exploring the association between rs2981582 polymorphism in the FGFR2 gene and breast cancer risk in Mexican women. The interaction found may be of great public health interest because alcohol consumption is a modifiable breast cancer risk factor. Therefore, replication of this finding is of foremost importance. {\textcopyright} 2013 IMSS.},

We used nationally representative samples of children (2-11 y) and female adolescents and adults (12-49 y) from the Mexican National Nutrition Survey 1999 and NHANES 1999-2006 to compare the diets of Mexicans (n = 5678), MA born in Mexico (MAMX) (n = 1488), MA born in the United States (MAUS) (n = 3654), and non-Hispanic white Americans (NH-White) (n = 5473). One 24-h diet recall was used to examine the percentage consuming and percentage energy consumed from selected food groups. Most of the food groups analyzed displayed a fairly linear increase or decrease in percent energy/capita intake in this order: Mexican, MAMX, MAUS, NH-White. However, few significant differences were observed among the US subpopulations, especially among MAUS and NH-Whites. Overall, compared to Mexicans, the US subpopulations had greater intakes of saturated fat, sugar, dessert and salty snacks, pizza and French fries, low-fat meat and fish, high-fiber bread, and low-fat milk, as well as decreased intakes of corn tortillas, low-fiber bread, high-fat milk, and Mexican fast food. Furthermore, the patterns were similar in all age groups. Although we found a mix of positive and negative aspects of food acculturation, the overall proportion of energy obtained from unhealthy foods was higher among the US subpopulations. Our findings indicate that within one generation in the US, the influence of the Mexican diet is almost lost. In addition, our results reinforce the need to discourage critical unhealthful components of the American diet among MA.},

Objective: This study aimed to examine the association between plasma concentrations of phytanic acid and subsequent risk of prostate cancer. Design: Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, 566 incident prostate cancer cases from Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom were individually matched to 566 controls by study center, age at recruitment, and time of day and duration of fasting at blood collection. Phytanic acid concentrations were measured by using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay. Results: In controls, plasma phytanic acid concentration was strongly correlated with dairy fat intake (r = 0.49, P {\textless} 0.0001), varied significantly by country (P for heterogeneity {\textless} 0.0001), and decreased with age (P for trend = 0.02) and duration of fasting at blood collection (P for trend = 0.002). There was no significant association of phytanic acid with prostate cancer risk overall (odds ratio for a doubling in concentration: 1.05; 95{\%} CI: 0.91, 1.21; P for trend = 0.53) or by stage or grade of disease. However, in men who had fasted ({\textgreater}3 h) at blood collection, the odds ratio for prostate cancer was 1.27 (95{\%} CI: 1.01, 1.60; P for trend = 0.04).

abstract = {Microsatellite instability (MSI) occurs in approximately 15{\%} of colon tumors. Other than relatively rare mutations in mismatch repair genes, the causes of MSI are not generally known. The purpose of this study was to determine if dietary intake of nutrients previously reported as being associated with colon cancer relate specifically to the MSI disease pathway. Data from a population-based case-control study of adenocarcinoma of the colon were used to evaluate associations between dietary intake and MSI. Participants were between 30 and 79 years of age at time of diagnosis and included both men and women. Dietary intake data were obtained from a computerized diet history questionnaire. MSI was evaluated in several ways: by a panel of 10 tetranucleotide repeats, and by 2 mononucleotide repeats, BAT-26 and TGFbetaRII. A total of 1,510 cases had valid study data and tumor DNA on which we were able to obtain MSI status. Cases with and without MSI were compared with dietary data reported by 2,410 population-based controls to determine dietary associations that may be different for these 2 subsets of cases. We compared dietary intake for cases with and without MSI to further determine associations that are specific to the MSI disease pathway. When comparing MSI+ to MSI- tumors we observed that long-term alcohol consumption, especially intake of liquor, increased the probability of having a tumor with MSI [odds ratio (OR) for MSI+ vs. MSI- tumors for alcohol 1.6, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.0-2.5; OR for liquor 1.6, 95{\%} CI 1.1-2.4]. The likelihood of having MSI in the tumor from the combined effects of high alcohol consumption and smoking cigarettes showed a 70{\%} excess in risk from the additive model. There were some suggestions that high intakes of refined grain might also be associated with MSI+ tumors, although associations were less consistent. Risk estimates for most other dietary factors did not differ substantially by MSI status. Data from this large population-based case-control study of colon cancer indicate that alcohol consumption, especially consumption of liquor, may increase the odds of an MSI+ tumor. Most other dietary factors do not appear operate exclusively in the MSI+ disease pathway.},

We conducted a genome-wide association study to identify risk loci for CRC. Methods This discovery stage included 8027 cases and 22,577 controls of East-Asian ancestry. Promising variants were evaluated in studies including as many as 11,044 cases and 12,047 controls. Tumor-adjacent normal tissues from 188 patients were analyzed to evaluate correlations of risk variants with expression levels of nearby genes. Potential functionality of risk variants were evaluated using public genomic and epigenomic databases. Results We identified 4 loci associated with CRC risk; P values for the most significant variant in each locus ranged from 3.92 × 10-8to 1.24 × 10-12: 6p21.1 (rs4711689), 8q23.3 (rs2450115, rs6469656), 10q24.3 (rs4919687), and 12p13.3 (rs11064437). We also identified 2 risk variants at loci previously associated with CRC: 10q25.2 (rs10506868) and 20q13.3 (rs6061231). These risk variants, conferring an approximate 10{\%}-18{\%} increase in risk per allele, are located either inside or near protein-coding genes that include transcription factor EB (lysosome biogenesis and autophagy), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit H (initiation of translation), cytochrome P450, family 17, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (steroidogenesis), splA/ryanodine receptor domain and SOCS box containing 2 (proteasome degradation), and ribosomal protein S2 (ribosome biogenesis). Gene expression analyses showed a significant association (P {\textless}.05) for rs4711689 with transcription factor EB, rs6469656 with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit H, rs11064437 with splA/ryanodine receptor domain and SOCS box containing 2, and rs6061231 with ribosomal protein S2. Conclusions We identified susceptibility loci and genes associated with CRC risk, linking CRC predisposition to steroid hormone, protein synthesis and degradation, and autophagy pathways and providing added insight into the mechanism of CRC pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Background—A diet high in red meat is an established colorectal cancer (CRC) risk factor. Carcinogens generated during meat cooking have been implicated as causal agents, and can induce oxidative DNA damage, which elicits repair by the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Methods—Using a family-based study we investigated the role of polymorphisms in four BER genes (APEX1 Gln51His, Asp148Glu; OGG1 Ser236Cys; PARP Val742Ala; XRCC1 Arg194Trp, Arg280His, Arg399Gln) as potential CRC risk factors and modifiers of the association between high-red meat or poultry diets and CRC risk. We tested for gene-environment interactions using case-only analyses (N = 577) and compared statistically significant results to those obtained using case-unaffected sibling comparisons (N = 307 sibships). Results—Carriers of the APEX1 codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared to carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype (OR 0.15, 95{\%} CI 0.03-0.69, p = 0.015). The association between higher red meat intake ({\textgreater}3 servings/week) and CRC was modified by the PARP Val762Ala SNP (case-only interaction p = 0.026). This SNP also modified the association between higher intake of high-temperature cooked red meat (case-only interaction p = 0.0009). Conclusions—We report evidence that the BER pathway PARP gene modifies the association of diets high in red meat cooked at high temperatures with risk of CRC. Impact—Our findings suggest a contribution to colorectal carcinogenesis of free radical damage as one of the possible harmful effects of a high-red meat diet.},

abstract = {In a genome-wide association study (GWAS), investigators typically focus their primary analysis on the direct (marginal) associations of each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with the trait. Some SNPs that are truly associated with the trait may not be identified in this scan if they have a weak marginal effect and thus low power to be detected. However, these SNPs may be quite important in subgroups of the population defined by an environmental or personal factor, and may be detectable if such a factor is carefully considered in a gene-environment (G × E) interaction analysis. We address the question "Using a genome wide interaction scan (GWIS), can we find new genes that were not found in the primary GWAS scan?" We review commonly used approaches for conducting a GWIS in case-control studies, and propose a new two-step screening and testing method (EDG×E) that is optimized to find genes with a weak marginal effect. We simulate several scenarios in which our two-step method provides 70-80{\%} power to detect a disease locus while a marginal scan provides less than 5{\%} power. We also provide simulations demonstrating that the EDG×E method outperforms other GWIS approaches (including case only and previously proposed two-step methods) for finding genes with a weak marginal effect. Application of this method to a G × Sex scan for childhood asthma reveals two potentially interesting SNPs that were not identified in the marginal-association scan. We distribute a new software program (G×Escan, available at http://biostats.usc.edu/software) that implements this new method as well as several other GWIS approaches.},

abstract = {Recent Genome-Wide Association Studies have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with breast cancer (BC) among women of Asian, European, and African-American ancestry. Nevertheless, the contribution of these variants in the South American population is unknown. Furthermore, there is little information about the effect of these risk alleles in women with early BC diagnosis. In the present study, we evaluated the association between rs3803662 (TOX3, also known as TNRC9), rs13387042 (2q35), and rs13281615 (8q24) with BC risk in 344 Chilean BRCA1/2-negative BC cases and in 801 controls. Two SNPs, rs3803662 and rs13387042, were significantly associated with increased BC risk in familial BC and in non-familial early-onset BC. The risk of BC increased in a dose-dependent manner with the number of risk alleles (P-trend {\textless} 0.0001 and 0.0091, respectively). The odds ratios for BC in familial BC and in early-onset non-familial BC were 3.76 (95{\%}CI 1.02-13.84, P = 0.046) and 8.0 (95{\%}CI 2.20-29.04, P = 0.002), respectively, for the maximum versus minimum number of risk alleles. These results indicate an additive effect of the TOX3 rs3803662 and 2q35 rs13387042 alleles for BC risk. We also evaluated the interaction between rs3803662 and rs13387042 SNPs. We observed an additive interaction only in non-familial early-onset BC cases (AP = 0.72 (0.28-1.16), P = 0.001). No significant association was observed for rs13281615 (8q24) with BC risk in women from the Chilean population. The strongly increased risk associated with the combination of low-penetrance risk alleles supports the polygenic inheritance model of BC.},

abstract = {Recent reports in the literature on the health status of southwestern Hispanics, most of whom are Mexican Americans, are reviewed critically. The review is organized into the following sections: infant mortality, mortality at other ages, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, other diseases, interview data on physical health, and mental health. Despite methodological limitations of much of the research, it can be concluded with some certainty that the health status of Hispanics in the Southwest is much more similar to the health status of other whites than that of blacks although socioeconomically, the status of Hispanics is closer to that of blacks. This observation is supported by evidence on such key health indicators as infant mortality, life-expectancy, mortality from cardiovascular diseases, mortality from major types of cancer, and measures of functional health. On other health indicators, such as diabetes and infectious and parasitic diseases, Hispanics appear to be clearly disadvantaged relative to other whites. Factors explaining the relative advantages or disadvantages of Hispanics include cultural practices, family supports, selective migration, diet, and genetic heritage. The recently completed Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey will go a long way to provide answers to many questions regarding the health of Hispanics in the Southwest or elsewhere.},

Moreover, accumulated clinical and experimental data indicate that the outcome of an immune response toward an evolving breast neoplasm is largely determined by the type of immune response elicited. Acute tumor-directed immune responses involving cytolytic T lymphocytes appear to protect against tumor development, whereas immune responses involving chronic activation of humoral immunity, infiltration by Th2 cells, and protumor-polarized innate inflammatory cells result in the promotion of tumor development and disease progression.

For the calibration substudy, subjects from each of eight subgroups defined by sex and ethnic group (African-American, Japanese-American, Latino, and White) were chosen randomly from among the cohort members, and each participant's previous day's diet was assessed by telephone recall on three occasions over approximately 2 months. After completing the three 24-hour recalls, each calibration subject was sent a second questionnaire; 1,606 persons completed three recalls and a second questionnaire (127 to 267 per ethnic-sex group). This report describes correlation coefficients and calibration slopes for the relation between the 24-hour recalls and second questionnaire values for a selected set of macro- and micronutrients, as absolute intakes, nutrient densities, and calorie-adjusted nutrients. In all subgroups, estimates of the correlation between the questionnaire and 24-hour recalls were greater after energy adjustment (average correlations ranged from 0.57-0.74 for nutrient densities and from 0.55-0.74 for calorie-adjusted nutrients) than when absolute nutrient values were used (average range 0.26-0.57). For absolute nutrient intakes, the correlations were greatest for Whites, somewhat lower for Japanese-Americans and Latinos, and lowest for African-Americans. After energy adjustment, the difference between subgroups were diminished, and the correlations were generally highly satisfactory.},

abstract = {Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs show chemopreventive efficacy in colon cancer, but the mechanism behind this remains unclear. Elucidating this mechanism is seen as vital to the development of new chemopreventive agents. We studied the effects of aspirin on the oncogenic Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activity in colorectal cancer cell lines and observed that aspirin dose-dependently decreased the activity of this pathway, as judged by TCF-driven luciferase activity, reduced Wnt target gene expression and increased phosphorylation of beta-catenin by immunoblotting. Furthermore, the ubiquitination and cytoplasmic levels of beta-catenin were assessed by immunoblotting, and also the localization of beta-catenin was shown by green fluorescent protein-tagged beta-catenin and time-lapse fluorescent imaging. Importantly, aspirin treatment caused increased phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), an event associated with inhibition of PP2A enzymatic activity, which was confirmed by a reduction in enzymatic PP2A activity. Moreover, this inhibition of PP2A enzymatic activity was essential for the effects of aspirin on the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway as shown by transient transfection with PP2A constructs. The findings in this article provide a molecular explanation for the efficacy of aspirin in chemoprevention of colorectal cancer and shows biochemical evidence that PP2A is an important regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activity in these cells.},

We measured the concentrations of four prevalent HAAs in spot urine samples collected at baseline from 170 participants of the Shanghai Cohort study, a population-based cohort study of adult men recruited during 1986 to 1989 in Shanghai, China. Sixteen (18.6{\%}) of 86 nonsmokers were positive for urinary 2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (AalphaC) versus 41 (48.8{\%}) of 84 cigarette smokers; the difference was statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.001). The number of cigarettes smoked per day was positively and significantly related to urinary levels of AalphaC in study subjects (P {\textless} 0.001); the mean level among nonsmokers was 2.54 ng/g creatinine, whereas the means for light (1-19 cigarettes per day) and heavy (20+ cigarettes per day) smokers were 7.50 and 11.92 ng/g creatinine, respectively. 2-Amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline was undetected in the urine of the 170 subjects. Only 5 (2.9{\%}) and 6 (3.5{\%}) subjects, respectively, showed detectable levels of urinary 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, and smoking status was unrelated to levels of either HAA. Quantitative measurements of HAAs in commonly eaten pork and chicken dishes in Shanghai showed low concentrations of HAAs ({\textless}1 ng/g meat). Our data indicate that AalphaC represents a major HAA exposure in adult men of Shanghai, China, and that tobacco smoke is an important point source of their AalphaC exposure.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer literature regarding the interaction between polymorphisms in carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes and red meat intake/doneness is inconsistent. A case-control study was conducted to evaluate the interaction between red meat consumption, doneness, and polymorphisms in carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes. Colorectal cancer cases diagnosed 1997 to 2000, ages 20 to 74 years, were identified through the population-based Ontario Cancer Registry and recruited by the Ontario Family Colorectal Cancer Registry. Controls were sex-matched and age group-matched random sample of Ontario population. Epidemiologic and food questionnaires were completed by 1,095 cases and 1,890 controls; blood was provided by 842 and 1,251, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression was used to obtain adjusted odds ratio (OR) estimates. Increased red meat intake was associated with increased colorectal cancer risk [OR ({\textgreater} 5 versus {\textless} or = 2 servings/wk), 1.67 (1.36-2.05)]. Colorectal cancer risk also increased significantly with well-done meat intake [OR ({\textgreater} 2 servings/wk well-done versus {\textless} or = 2 servings/wk rare-regular), 1.57 (1.27-1.93)]. We evaluated interactions between genetic variants in 15 enzymes involved in the metabolism of carcinogens in overcooked meat (cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, SULT, NAT, mEH, and AHR). CYP2C9 and NAT2 variants were associated with colorectal cancer risk. Red meat intake was associated with increased colorectal cancer risk regardless of genotypes; however, CYP1B1 combined variant and SULT1A1-638G{\textgreater}A variant significantly modified the association between red meat doneness intake and colorectal cancer risk. In conclusion, well-done red meat intake was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer regardless of carcinogen-metabolizing genotype, although our data suggest that persons with CYP1B1 and SULT1A1 variants had the highest colorectal cancer risk.},

In medicine, such measurements are often used to assess risk or prognosis or to select a therapy. However, the question of how best to use information from continuous variables is relevant in many areas. To relate an outcome variable to a single continuous variable, a suitable regression model is required. A simple and popular approach is to assume a linear effect, but the linearity assumption may be violated. Alternatively, researchers typically apply cutpoints to categorize the variable, implying regression models with step functions. We illustrate problems caused by categorization and introduce fractional polynomials (FP) as a useful extension of polynomial regression. Investigating the effect of age as a prognostic factor for breast cancer, we show how conclusions depend critically on how the continuous variable is analyzed.},

abstract = {False discovery rate control has become an essential tool in any study that has a very large multiplicity problem. False discovery rate-controlling procedures have also been found to be very effective in QTL analysis, ensuring reproducible results with few falsely discovered linkages and offering increased power to discover QTL, although their acceptance has been slower than in microarray analysis, for example. The reason is partly because the methodological aspects of applying the false discovery rate to QTL mapping are not well developed. Our aim in this work is to lay a solid foundation for the use of the false discovery rate in QTL mapping. We review the false discovery rate criterion, the appropriate interpretation of the FDR, and alternative formulations of the FDR that appeared in the statistical and genetics literature. We discuss important features of the FDR approach, some stemming from new developments in FDR theory and methodology, which deem it especially useful in linkage analysis. We review false discovery rate-controlling procedures--the BH, the resampling procedure, and the adaptive two-stage procedure-and discuss the validity of these procedures in single- and multiple-trait QTL mapping. Finally we argue that the control of the false discovery rate has an important role in suggesting, indicating the significance of, and confirming QTL and present guidelines for its use.},

abstract = {To characterize somatic alterations in colorectal carcinoma, we conducted a genome-scale analysis of 276 samples, analysing exome sequence, DNA copy number, promoter methylation and messenger RNA and microRNA expression. A subset of these samples (97) underwent low-depth-of-coverage whole-genome sequencing. In total, 16{\%} of colorectal carcinomas were found to be hypermutated: three-quarters of these had the expected high microsatellite instability, usually with hypermethylation and MLH1 silencing, and one-quarter had somatic mismatch-repair gene and polymerase $\epsilon$ (POLE) mutations. Excluding the hypermutated cancers, colon and rectum cancers were found to have considerably similar patterns of genomic alteration. Twenty-four genes were significantly mutated, and in addition to the expected APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and KRAS mutations, we found frequent mutations in ARID1A, SOX9 and FAM123B. Recurrent copy-number alterations include potentially drug-targetable amplifications of ERBB2 and newly discovered amplification of IGF2. Recurrent chromosomal translocations include the fusion of NAV2 and WNT pathway member TCF7L1. Integrative analyses suggest new markers for aggressive colorectal carcinoma and an important role for MYC-directed transcriptional activation and repression.},

abstract = {U.S. populations are genetically admixed, but surprisingly little empirical data exists documenting the impact of such heterogeneity on type I and type II error in genetic-association studies of unrelated individuals. By applying several complementary analytical techniques, we characterize genetic background heterogeneity among 810 selfidentified African American subjects sampled as part of a multisite cohort study of cardiovascular disease in older adults. On the basis of the typing of 24 ancestry-informative biallelic single-nucleotide–polymorphism markers, there was evidence of substantial population substructure and admixture.We used an allele-sharing–based clustering algorithm to infer evidence for four genetically distinct subpopulations. Using multivariable regression models, we demonstrate the complex interplay of genetic and socioeconomic factors on quantitative phenotypes related to cardiovascular disease and aging. Blood glucose level correlated with individual African ancestry, whereas body mass index was associated more strongly with genetic similarity. Blood pressure, HDL cholesterol level, C-reactive protein level, and carotid wall thickness were not associated with genetic background. Blood pressure and HDL cholesterol level varied by geographic site, whereas C-reactive protein level differed by occupation. Both ancestry and genetic similarity predicted the number and quality of years lived during follow-up, but socioeconomic factors largely accounted for these associations. When the 24 genetic markers were tested individually, there were an excess number of marker-trait associations, most of which were attenuated by adjustment for genetic ancestry.We conclude that the genetic demography underlying older individuals who self identify as African American is complex, and that controlling for both genetic admixture and socioeconomic characteristics will be required in assessing genetic associations with chronic-disease–related traits in African Americans. Complementary methods that identify discrete subgroups on the basis of genetic similarity may help to further characterize the complex biodemographic structure of human populations.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the power to identify gene x gene interactions in genome-wide association studies. In our analysis we focus on two-stage analyses: analyses in which we only test for interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms that show some marginal effect. We give two algorithms to compute significance levels for such an analyses. One involves a Bonferoni correction on the number of interactions that are actually tested, and one is a resampling procedure similar to the one proposed by [Lin (2006) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 78:505-509]. We also give an algorithm to carry out approximate power calculations for studies that plan to use a two-stage analysis. We find that for most plausible interaction effects a two-stage analysis can dramatically increase the power to identify interactions compared to a single-stage analysis based on simulation studies using known genetic models and data from existing genome-wide association studies.},

abstract = {When missing data occur in one or more covariates in a regression model, multiple imputation (MI) is widely advocated as an improvement over complete-case analysis (CC). We use theoretical arguments and simulation studies to compare these methods with MI implemented under a missing at random assumption. When data are missing completely at random, both methods have negligible bias, and MI is more efficient than CC across a wide range of scenarios. For other missing data mechanisms, bias arises in one or both methods. In our simulation setting, CC is biased towards the null when data are missing at random. However, when missingness is independent of the outcome given the covariates, CC has negligible bias and MI is biased away from the null. With more general missing data mechanisms, bias tends to be smaller for MI than for CC. Since MI is not always better than CC for missing covariate problems, the choice of method should take into account what is known about the missing data mechanism in a particular substantive application. Importantly, the choice of method should not be based on comparison of standard errors. We propose new ways to understand empirical differences between MI and CC, which may provide insights into the appropriateness of the assumptions underlying each method, and we propose a new index for assessing the likely gain in precision from MI: the fraction of incomplete cases among the observed values of a covariate (FICO).},

Conditioned medium was then used to evaluate the induction of HUVEC tubulogenesis and migration. Secretion of VEGF in this medium was evaluated by Western blot analysis. The expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), the initiator of a proangiogenic pathway, was evaluated with Western blot analysis of HUVEC lysates. The subsequent effects of an ER inhibitor (fulvestrant/ICI) and a neutralizing VEGF antibody were also observed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Estrogen receptor $\alpha$ and ER$\beta$ are expressed in thyroid cancer cells. Estrogen-stimulated ML-1 cells secreted an increased amount of VEGF likely as a result of ER signaling. In contact with this environment, HUVECs demonstrate enhanced tubulogenesis and migration. Western blot analysis documented estrogen-mediated upregulation of PI3K in HUVECs. These effects were mitigated by an ER inhibitor (fulvestrant/ICI) and a neutralizing VEGF antibody.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that estrogen can induce a proangiogenic endothelial cell phenotype in the thyroid tumor microenvironment through ER and VEGF signaling. Our findings suggest that the effect of antiestrogenic therapy targeting tumor angiogenesis can be enhanced through VEGF inhibition.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW Many phenotypes of asthma exist, ranging from mild asthma with onset during childhood to severe asthma with later onset, making asthma a broad disease with different pathologies. A gender disparity exists in asthma prevalence. As adults, women have an increased asthma prevalence compared to men. Further, women are more likely to have severe asthma and a later onset of asthma compared to men. Here, we review clinical and animal studies that have defined the role of sex hormones in airway inflammation, smooth muscle contraction, mucus production, and airway mechanics associated with asthma pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS Clinical evidence shows that increased asthma symptoms occur in females starting at puberty compared to those in boys. However, after puberty, the role for sex hormones in regulating asthma symptoms during menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause is not as clear. Animal studies have shown that estrogen increases and testosterone decreases Th2-mediated airway inflammation, and that females have increased IL-17A-mediated airway inflammation compared to males. Further, females had increased DC and Mϕ function compared to males. However, the mechanisms driving the types of allergic inflammation are not fully elucidated. Overall, ovarian hormones increased and testosterone decreased airway inflammation in asthma, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Delineating these pathways using animal models as well as women and men with various phenotypes of asthma will help determine if women with asthma should take (or avoid) hormonal contraceptives as well as predict changes in asthma symptoms during life phases, including pregnancy and menopause, when sex hormones are dramatically changing.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a soluble fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor type 1 (FGFR1) extracellular domain in the circulation and in vascular basement membranes. However, the process of FGFR1 ectodomain release from the plasma membrane is not known. Here we report that the 72-kDa gelatinase A (matrix metalloproteinase type 2, MMP2) can hydrolyze the Val368-Met369 peptide bond of the FGFR1 ectodomain, eight amino acids upstream of the transmembrane domain, thus releasing the entire extracellular domain. Similar results were obtained regardless of whether FGF was first bound to the receptor or not. The action of MMP2 abolished binding of FGF to an immobilized recombinant FGFR1 ectodomain fusion protein and to Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing FGFR1 The released recombinant FGFR1 ectodomain was able to bind FGF after MMP2 cleavage, suggesting that the cleaved soluble receptor maintained its FGF binding capacity. The activity of MMP2 could not be reproduced by the 92-kDa gelatinase B (MMP9) and was inhibited by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase type 2. These studies demonstrate that FGFR1 may be a specific target for MMP2 on the cell surface, yielding a soluble FGF receptor that may modulate the mitogenic and angiogenic activities of FGF.},

We examined associations between meat intake, HCA exposure, acetylator genotype, and breast cancer risk in a case-control study of 2,686 case women and 3,508 controls. Women were asked to report their usual intake, cooking method, and preferred doneness of specific meats. We observed no association between total meat, red meat, or chicken with breast cancer risk. Women who consumed 5 or more servings of meat per week had no increased risk of breast cancer compared to women consuming fewer than 2 servings per week (OR = 0.99, 95{\%} CI 0.84-1.15). No statistically significant associations with breast cancer were found for individual HCAs or for total estimated mutagenic activity of meat. Results varied modestly according to menopausal status. There were no statistically significant interactions with NAT2 genotype. Results do not support an important association of HCAs with breast cancer risk, although potential biases in case-control studies should be considered.},

abstract = {There has been increasing concern about the impact of environmental compounds with hormone-like action on human development and reproductive health over the past decades. An alternative but neglected source of hormone action that may be considered in this connection is hormone residues in meat from husbandry animals treated with sex steroid hormones for growth promotion. Treatment of cattle with naturally occurring or synthetic sex hormones may enhance lean muscle growth and improve feed efficiency and is therefore a very cost effective procedure for cattle producers who have used it for decades in some Western countries, including the USA and Canada. The Joint Food and Agricultural Organisation/World Health Organisation (FAO/WHO) expert committee on food additives (JECFA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considered, in 1988, that the residues found in meat from treated animals were safe for the consumers. We have re-evaluated the JECFA conclusions regarding the safety of estradiol residues in meat in the light of recent scientific data, with special emphasis on estradiol levels in prepubertal children. These levels are needed for estimates of the normal daily production rates of estradiol in children, who may be particularly sensitive to low levels of estradiol. In our opinion, the conclusions by JECFA concerning the safety of hormone residues in meat seem to be based on uncertain assumptions and inadequate scientific data. Our concerns can be summarized as follows. 1) The data on residue levels in meat were based on studies performed in the 1970's and 1980's using radioimmunoassay (RIA) methods available at the time. The sensitivity of the methods was generally inadequate to measure precisely the low levels found in animal tissues, and considerable variation between different RIA methods for measuring steroids exists. Therefore the reported residue levels may be subject to considerable uncertainty. 2) Only limited information on the levels of the various metabolites of the steroids was given despite the fact that metabolites also may have biological activity. 3) Reliable data on daily production rates of steroid hormones were and are still lacking in healthy prepubertal children. This lack is crucial as previous guidelines regarding acceptable levels of steroid residues in edible animal tissues have been based on very questionable estimates of production rates in children. Thus, even today the US FDA bases its guidelines on the presumably highly overestimated production rates in prepubertal children given in the JECFA 1988 report. 4) The possible biological significance of very low levels of estradiol is neglected. In conclusion, based on our current knowledge possible adverse effects on human health by consumption of meat from hormone-treated animals cannot be excluded.},

Overall, TLR1 rs7696175 (HR 1.40, 95{\%} CI 1.03, 1.91; Padj=0.032), TLR4 rs5030728 (HR 1.96, 95{\%} CI 1.30, 2.95; Padj=0.014), and TNFRSF1A rs4149578 (HR 2.71, 95{\%} CI 1.28, 5.76; Padj=0.029) were associated with increased breast cancer mortality. We observed several statistically significant interactions after adjustment for multiple comparisons, including interactions between our dietary oxidative balance score and CD40LG and TNFSF1A; between cigarette smoking and TLR1, TLR4, and TNF; between body mass index (BMI) among pre-menopausal women and TRAF2; and between regular use of aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and TLR3 and TRA2. In conclusion, our findings support a contributing role of certain TNF-$\alpha$ and TLR genes in both breast cancer risk and survival, particularly among women with higher NA ancestry. Diet and lifestyle factors appear to be important mediators of the breast cancer risk associated with these genes.},

Selenoproteins have previously been associated with risk of various cancers and redox-related diseases. In this study we evaluated possible associations between breast cancer risk and survival and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the selenoprotein genes GPX1, GPX2, GPX3, GPX4, SELS, SEP15, SEPN1, SEPP1, SEPW1, TXNRD1, and TXNRD2 among Hispanic/Native American (2111 cases, 2597 controls) and non-Hispanic white (NHW) (1481 cases, 1586 controls) women in the Breast Cancer Health Disparities Study. Adaptive Rank Truncated Product (ARTP) analysis was used to determine both gene and pathway significance with these genes. The overall selenoprotein pathway PARTP was not significantly associated with breast cancer risk (PARTP = 0.69), and only one gene, GPX3, was of borderline significance for the overall population (PARTP =0.09) and marginally significant among women with 0-28{\%} Native American (NA) ancestry (PARTP=0.06). The SEPP1 gene was statistically significantly associated with breast cancer risk among women with higher NA ancestry (PARTP=0.002) and contributed to a significant pathway among those women (PARTP=0.04). GPX1, GPX3, and SELS were associated with Estrogen Receptor-/Progesterone Receptor+ status (PARTP = 0.002, 0.05, and 0.01, respectively). Four SNPs (GPX3 rs2070593, rsGPX4 rs2074451, SELS rs9874, and TXNRD1 rs17202060) significantly interacted with dietary oxidative balance score after adjustment for multiple comparisons to alter breast cancer risk. GPX4 was significantly associated with breast cancer survival among those with the highest NA ancestry (PARTP = 0.05) only. Our data suggest that SEPP1 alters breast cancer risk among women with higher levels of NA ancestry.},

Several high-profile situations exist in which randomized controlled trials of precisely the same intervention that has been examined in observational studies have produced markedly different findings. In other observational sciences, the use of instrumental variable (IV) approaches has been one approach to strengthening causal inferences in non-experimental situations. The use of germline genetic variants that proxy for environmentally modifiable exposures as instruments for these exposures is one form of IV analysis that can be implemented within observational epidemiological studies. The method has been referred to as 'Mendelian randomization', and can be considered as analogous to randomized controlled trials. This paper outlines Mendelian randomization, draws parallels with IV methods, provides examples of implementation of the approach and discusses limitations of the approach and some methods for dealing with these.},

abstract = {Inflammation is the result of the loss of host's resilience towards the surrounding world. At gross tissue level, inflammation coincides with fluid leakage from vessels, swelling, and blood stasis and extravasation of mononuclear/macrophage cells. Biochemically, these events lead to anoxia and dramatic changes: interruption of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, influx of the M1 macrophage subset, which live on anaerobic glycolysis. Fall of ATP then leads to energy shortage and debt. In their chronic forms, these phenomena are now known to mark a number of degenerative disorders that have invaded the Western World since the last century: Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's syndromes, rheumatic diseases, metabolic diseases. Intriguingly, these affections seem to derive from the gut, along two possible pathways. A sort of ascending loss of function caused by accumulation of (and hyperreactivity to) proteins released to restrain spread of enteric viruses: the alpha-synucleins, now increasingly spotted in relation to Parkinson's pathogenesis. The second pathway would entail the intellectual decline perhaps brought about by large use of food containing the proteins of red processed meat. The bacterium Bilophila wadsworthia, thriving in this meat, can erode the mucus layer on colon surfaces, allowing further bacterial flora to approach lining cells, so upgrading the alarm state. We discuss two strategies to prevent such instability from ending up to full-blown inflammatory bowel disease: physical exercise and systematic switch to fibre-containing diets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between red meat intake and breast cancer is unclear, but most studies have assessed diet in midlife or later. Although breast tumors differ clinically and biologically by hormone receptor status, few epidemiologic studies of diet have made this distinction. METHODS: Red meat intake and breast cancer risk were assessed among premenopausal women aged 26 to 46 years in the Nurses' Health Study II. Red meat intake was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire administered in 1991, 1995, and 1999, with respondents followed up through 2003. Breast cancers were self-reported and confirmed by review of pathologic reports. RESULTS: During 12 years of follow-up of 90,659 premenopausal women, we documented 1021 cases of invasive breast carcinoma. Greater red meat intake was strongly related to elevated risk of breast cancers that were estrogen and progesterone receptor positive (ER+/PR+; n = 512) but not to those that were estrogen and progesterone receptor negative (ER-/PR-; n = 167). Compared with those eating 3 or fewer servings per week of red meat, the multivariate relative risks (95{\%} confidence intervals) for ER+/PR+ breast cancer with increasing servings of red meat intake were 1.14 (0.90-1.45) for more than 3 to 5 or fewer servings per week, 1.42 (1.06-1.90) for more than 5 per week to 1 or fewer servings per day, 1.20 (0.89-1.63) for more than 1 to 1.5 or fewer servings per day, and 1.97 (1.35-2.88) for more than 1.5 servings per day (test for trend, P = .001). The corresponding relative risks for ER-/PR- breast cancer were 1.34 (0.89-2.00), 1.21 (0.73-2.00), 0.69 (0.39-1.23), and 0.89 (0.43-1.84) (test for trend, P = .28). Higher intakes of several individual red meat items were also strongly related to elevated risk of ER+/PR+ breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Higher red meat intake may be a risk factor for ER+/PR+ breast cancer among premenopausal women.},

Nutritional factors are often mentioned as determinants of BC but their relevance is not well established in Latin-American countries, where dietary habits show great variation. From a study population previously assembled in Mexico City, 141 histologically confirmed cases of BC were matched by age (+/-3 yr) to an equal number of hospital controls. A food frequency questionnaire was administered to all subjects and the risk of BC was estimated in relation to the intake of selected nutrients. The findings of this study show a protective effect against BC due to a high intake of polyunsaturated fat (odds ratio, OR = 0.10, 95{\%} CI = 0.02-0.40, P for trend = 0.001) and vitamin E (OR = 0.10, 95{\%} CI = 0.02-0.44, P for trend = 0.003) among postmenopausal women.

abstract = {Adolescence is a highly susceptible period for mammary carcinogenesis, but few prospective studies have examined the role of adolescent diet in breast cancer risk. Reduced rank regression has previously been used to identify a dietary pattern associated with markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, IL6, and TNF$\alpha$ receptor 2). We investigated whether an adolescent and early adulthood inflammatory dietary pattern was associated with breast cancer among 45,204 women in the Nurses' Health Study II using reduced rank regression. Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire in 1998 about their high school diet (HS-FFQ) and a FFQ in 1991 when they were ages 27-44 years. Among women who completed the HS-FFQ, 1,477 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed during 22 years of follow-up. An adolescent and early adulthood dietary pattern characterized by inflammation was associated with an increased incidence of premenopausal but not postmenopausal breast cancer. Women in the fifth quintile of the inflammatory pattern score had multivariable adjusted HRs for premenopausal breast cancer of 1.35 for adolescent diet [95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI), 1.06-1.73; Ptrend = 0.002] and 1.41 for early adulthood diet (95{\%} CI, 1.11-1.78; Ptrend = 0.006) compared with women in the first quintile. The corresponding RRs for postmenopausal breast cancer were 0.84 (95{\%} CI, 0.60-1.17) for adolescent and 0.76 (95{\%} CI, 0.54-1.06) for adult intake. Overall, our findings support the notion that an adolescent and early adulthood diet characterized by high intake of sugar-sweetened and diet soft drinks, refined grains, red and processed meat, and margarine, and low intake of green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, and coffee may increase the incidence of premenopausal breast cancer.

However, chronic inflammation triggers cellular events that can promote malignant transformation of cells and carcinogenesis. Several inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-$\alpha$, IL-6, TGF-$\beta$, and IL-10, have been shown to participate in both the initiation and progression of cancer. In this review, we explore the role of these cytokines in important events of carcinogenesis, such as their capacity to generate reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, their potential mutagenic effect, and their involvement in mechanisms for epithelial mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Finally, we will provide an in-depth analysis of the participation of these cytokines in two types of cancer attributable to chronic inflammatory disease: colitis-associated colorectal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focus on relatively few highly significant loci, whereas less attention is given to other genotyped markers. Using pathway analysis to study existing GWAS data may shed light on relevant biological processes and illuminate new candidate genes. We applied a pathway-based approach to the breast cancer GWAS data of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility project that includes 1,145 cases and 1,142 controls. Pathways were retrieved from three databases: KEGG, BioCarta, and NCI Protein Interaction Database. Genes were represented by their most strongly associated SNP, and an enrichment score reflecting the overrepresentation of gene-based association signals in each pathway was calculated by using a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov procedure. Finally, hierarchical clustering was used to identify pathways with overlapping genes, and clusters with an excess of association signals were determined by the adaptive rank-truncated product (ARTP) method. A total of 421 pathways containing 3,962 genes was included in our study. Of these, three pathways (syndecan-1–mediated signaling, signaling of hepatocyte growth factor receptor, and growth hormone signaling) were highly enriched with association signals [PES {\textless} 0.001, false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.118]. Our clustering analysis revealed that pathways containing key components of the RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase canonical signaling cascade were significantly more likely to have an excess of association signals than expected by chance (PARTP = 0.0051, FDR = 0.07). These results suggest that genetic alterations associated with these three pathways and one canonical signaling cascade may contribute to breast cancer susceptibility.

abstract = {Cooking fish at high temperature can produce potent carcinogens such as heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The effects of these carcinogens may undergo modification by the enzymes responsible for their detoxification and/or activation. In this study, we investigated genetic polymorphisms in nine carcinogen metabolism enzymes and their modifying effects on the association between white or dark fish consumption and prostate cancer (PCA) risk. We genotyped 497 localized and 936 advanced PCA cases and 760 controls from the California Collaborative Case-Control Study of Prostate Cancer. Three polymorphisms, EPHX1 Tyr113His, CYP1B1 Leu432Val and GSTT1 null/present, were associated with localized PCA risk. The PTGS2 765 G/C polymorphism modified the association between white fish consumption and advanced PCA risk (interaction P 5 0.002), with high white fish consumption being positively associated with risk only among carriers of the C allele. This effect modification by PTGS2 genotype was stronger when restricted to consumption of well-done white fish (interaction P 5 0.021). These findings support the hypotheses that changes in white fish brought upon by high-temperature cooking methods, such as carcinogen accumulation and/or fatty acid composition changes, may contribute to prostate carcinogenesis. However, the gene-diet interactions should be interpreted with caution given the limited sample size. Thus, our findings require further validation with additional studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Imputation of partially missing or unobserved genotypes is an indispensable tool for SNP data analyses. However, research and understanding of the impact of initial SNP-data quality control on imputation results is still limited. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the effect of different strategies of pre-imputation quality filtering on the performance of the widely used imputation algorithms MaCH and IMPUTE.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We considered three scenarios: imputation of partially missing genotypes with usage of an external reference panel, without usage of an external reference panel, as well as imputation of completely un-typed SNPs using an external reference panel. We first created various datasets applying different SNP quality filters and masking certain percentages of randomly selected high-quality SNPs. We imputed these SNPs and compared the results between the different filtering scenarios by using established and newly proposed measures of imputation quality. While the established measures assess certainty of imputation results, our newly proposed measures focus on the agreement with true genotypes. These measures showed that pre-imputation SNP-filtering might be detrimental regarding imputation quality. Moreover, the strongest drivers of imputation quality were in general the burden of missingness and the number of SNPs used for imputation. We also found that using a reference panel always improves imputation quality of partially missing genotypes. MaCH performed slightly better than IMPUTE2 in most of our scenarios. Again, these results were more pronounced when using our newly defined measures of imputation quality.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Even a moderate filtering has a detrimental effect on the imputation quality. Therefore little or no SNP filtering prior to imputation appears to be the best strategy for imputing small to moderately sized datasets. Our results also showed that for these datasets, MaCH performs slightly better than IMPUTE2 in most scenarios at the cost of increased computing time.},

In this study, the synergistic effects of estrogen (E2) and hypoxia on ER$\alpha$-mediated transactivation and ER$\alpha$ degradation were investigated. ER$\alpha$-mediated transcriptional activity was synergistically increased by E2and hypoxia, as determined by the transient expression of ER$\alpha$ and ER-responsive reporter plasmids in HEK 293 cells. Twenty hours of E2and hypoxia treatment synergistically induced degradation of ER$\alpha$ by 95{\%} via a proteasome-dependent pathway in MCF-7 cells.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature Identifying gene–environment interactions is a central challenge in the quest to understand susceptibility to complex, multi-factorial diseases. Developing an understanding of how inter-individual variability in inherited genetic variation alters the effects of environmental exposures will enhance our knowledge of disease mechanisms and improve our ability to predict disease and target interventions to high-risk sub-populations. Limited progress has been made identifying gene–environment interactions in the epidemiological setting using existing statistical approaches for genome-wide searches for interaction. In this paper, we describe a novel two-step approach using omics data to conduct genome-wide searches for gene–environment interactions. Using existing genome-wide SNP data from a large Bangladeshi cohort study specifically designed to assess the effect of arsenic exposure on health, we evaluated gene-arsenic interactions by first conducting genome-wide searches for SNPs that modify the effect of arsenic on molecular phenotypes (gene expression and DNA methylation features). Using this set of SNPs showing evidence of interaction with arsenic in relation to molecular phenotypes, we then tested SNP–arsenic interactions in relation to skin lesions, a hallmark characteristic of arsenic toxicity. With the emergence of additional omics data in the epidemiologic setting, our approach may have the potential to boost power for genome-wide interaction research, enabling the identification of interactions that will enhance our understanding of disease etiology and our ability to develop interventions targeted at susceptible sub-populations.},

abstract = {Oestrogens exert their actions via specific nuclear protein receptors that are members of the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily of transcription factors. Recently, a second oestrogen receptor (ERbeta) has been cloned, and using reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry it has been shown to have a wide tissue distribution in the rat that is distinct from the classical oestrogen receptor, ERalpha. Using commercial polyclonal antisera against peptides specific to human ERbeta, we have determined the sites of ERbeta expression in archival and formalin-fixed human tissue and compared its expression with that of ERalpha. ERbeta was localised to the cell nuclei of a wide range of normal adult human tissues including ovary, Fallopian tube, uterus, lung, kidney, brain, heart, prostate and testis. In the ovary, ERbeta was present in multiple cell types including granulosa cells in small, medium and large follicles, theca and corpora lutea, whereas ERalpha was weakly expressed in the nuclei of granulosa cells, but not in the theca nor in the copora lutea. In the endometrium, both ERalpha and ERbeta were observed in luminal epithelial cells and in the nuclei of stromal cells but, significantly, ERbeta was weak or absent from endometrial glandular epithelia. Epithelial cells in most male tissues including the prostate, the urothelium and muscle layers of the bladder, and Sertoli cells in the testis, were also immunopositive for ERbeta. Significant ERbeta immunoreactivity was detected in most areas of the brain, with the exception of the hippocampus - a tissue that stained positively for ERalpha. In conclusion, the almost ubiquitous immunohistochemical localisation of ERbeta indicates that ERbeta may play a major role in the mediation of oestrogen action. The differential expression of ERalpha and ERbeta in some of these tissues suggests a more complex control mechanism in oestrogenic potential than originally envisioned.},

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) has been shown to play an important role in modulating the inflammatory environment during neuroinflammation and importantly in protecting myelin from excitotoxic cell death. Considering the sexual dimorphism in the functional properties of oligodendrocytes and the importance of a systemic inflammation in the progression of multiple sclerosis, we focused on identifying possible sex-related differences in the alterations previously reported for the two phosphodiesterase4B (PDE4B) splice-variants (PDE4B2 and PDE4B3) mRNA expression during innate neuroinflammation. PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D are present in oligodendrocytes and we have previously reported that PDE4B3 mRNA is readily expressed in both oligodendrocytes and neurons. In this study, we analyzed the influence of an intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide injection on the distribution pattern and expression levels of the PDE4B mRNA splicing variants in both male and female mice brains. Clear differences were observed in PDE4B2 and PDE4B3 mRNA expression levels in males compared with females in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, we observed that the clear downregulation of PDE4B3 mRNA was reflected in a lower percentage of oligodendrocytes positive for this transcript which correlated with a decrease in inducible cAMP early repressor expression in female corpus callosum.},

abstract = {Over the past three decades, molecular genetic studies have revealed some critical mutations underlying the pathogenesis of the sporadic and inherited forms of colorectal cancer (CRC). A relatively limited number of oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes-most prominently the APC, KRAS, and p53 genes-are mutated in a sizeable fraction of CRCs, and a larger collection of genes that are mutated in subsets of CRC have begun to be defined. Together with DNA-methylation and chromatin-structure changes, the mutations act to dysregulate conserved signaling networks that exert context-dependent effects on critical cell phenotypes, including the regulation of cellular metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Much work remains to be done to fully understand the nature and significance of the individual and collective genetic and epigenetic defects in CRC. Some key concepts for the field have emerged, two of which are emphasized in this review. Specifically, the gene defects in CRC often target proteins and pathways that exert pleiotropic effects on the cancer cell phenotype, and particular genetic and epigenetic alterations are linked to biologically and clinically distinct subsets of CRC.},

Crucial for their organization and function is a highly specialized network of cell adhesion and polarity proteins aligned along the apical-basal axis. Comparing breast and intestinal tissue as examples of common cancer sites, reveals an important contribution of polarity proteins to the initiation and progression of cancer. Defects in polarity are induced directly by mutations in polarity proteins, but also indirectly by changes in the expression of specific microRNAs and altered transcriptional programs that drive cellular differentiation from epithelial to more mesenchymal characteristics.

Epidemiological and mechanistic data on associations between red and processed meat intake and CRC are inconsistent and underlying mechanisms are unclear.

abstract = {Mediterranean-style diets caused a significant decline in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in early landmark studies. The effect of a traditional Mediterranean diet on lipoprotein oxidation showed that there was a significant reduction in oxidative stress in the intervention group (Mediterranean diet + Virgin Olive Oil) compared to the low-fat diet group. Conversely, the increase in oxidative stress causing inflammation is a unifying hypothesis for predisposing people to atherosclerosis, carcinogenesis, and osteoporosis. The impact of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents on cancer and cardiovascular disease, and the interventive mechanisms for the inhibition of proliferation, inflammation, invasion, metastasis, and activation of apoptosis were explored. Following the Great Oxygen Event some 2.3 billion years ago, organisms have needed antioxidants to survive. Natural products in food preservatives are preferable to synthetic compounds due to their lower volatility and stability and generally higher antioxidant potential. Free radicals, reactive oxygen species, antioxidants, pro-oxidants and inflammation are described with examples of free radical damage based on the hydroxyl, nitric oxide and superoxide radicals. Flavonoid antioxidants with 2- or 3-phenylchroman structures such as quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, apigenin, and luteolin, constituents of fruits, vegetables, tea, and wine, which may reduce coronary disease and cancer, are described. The protective effect of flavonoids on the DNA damage caused by hydroxyl radicals through chelation is an important mechanism, though the converse may be possible, e.g., quercetin. The antioxidant properties of carotenoids, which are dietary natural pigments, have been studied in relation to breast cancer risk and an inverse association was found with plasma concentrations: higher levels mean lower risk. The manipulation of primary and secondary human metabolomes derived especially from existing or transformed gut microbiota was explored as a possible alternative to single-agent dietary interventions for cancer and cardiovascular disease. Sustained oxidative stress leading to inflammation and thence to possibly to cancer and cardiovascular disease is described for spices and herbs, using curcumin as an example of an intervention, based on activation of transcription factors which suggest that oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and cancer are closely linked.},

abstract = {There is a large amount of functional genetic data available, which can be used to inform fine-mapping association studies (in diseases with well-characterised disease pathways). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) prioritization via Bayes factors is attractive because prior information can inform the effect size or the prior probability of causal association. This approach requires the specification of the effect size. If the information needed to estimate a priori the probability density for the effect sizes for causal SNPs in a genomic region isn't consistent or isn't available, then specifying a prior variance for the effect sizes is challenging. We propose both an empirical method to estimate this prior variance, and a coherent approach to using SNP-level functional data, to inform the prior probability of causal association. Through simulation we show that when ranking SNPs by our empirical Bayes factor in a fine-mapping study, the causal SNP rank is generally as high or higher than the rank using Bayes factors with other plausible values of the prior variance. Importantly, we also show that assigning SNP-specific prior probabilities of association based on expert prior functional knowledge of the disease mechanism can lead to improved causal SNPs ranks compared to ranking with identical prior probabilities of association. We demonstrate the use of our methods by applying the methods to the fine mapping of the CASP8 region of chromosome 2 using genotype data from the Collaborative Oncological Gene-Environment Study (COGS) Consortium. The data we analysed included approximately 46,000 breast cancer case and 43,000 healthy control samples.},

Our aim was to study associations of fish and EPA + DHA consumption with bone mineral density (BMD) and hip fracture risk and determine whether high linoleic acid (LA) intake, the major dietary n-6 PUFA, modifies the associations. The study population consisted of 5045 participants aged 65 years and older from the Cardiovascular Health Study. Data on BMD were available for 1305 participants. Food-frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary intake, and hip fracture incidence was assessed prospectively by review of hospitalization records. After multivariable adjustment, femoral neck BMD was 0.01 g/cm(2) lower in the highest versus lowest tuna/other-fish intake category (p = .05 for trend). EPA + DHA intake (higher versus lower median of 0.32 g/day) was associated with lower femoral neck BMD (0.66 versus 0.71 g/cm(2), p {\textless} .001) among those with LA intake greater than the median 12.1 g/day (p = .03 for interaction). No significant associations were found with total-hip BMD. During mean follow-up of 11.1 years, 505 hip fractures occurred. Fish or EPA + DHA consumption was not significantly associated with fracture incidence [hazard ratio (HR) for extreme categories: HR = 1.23, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.83-1.84 for tuna/other fish; HR = 1.16, 95{\%} CI 0.91-1.49 for fried fish; and HR = 0.98, 95{\%} CI 0.71-1.36 for EPA + DHA]. High LA intake did not modify these associations. In this large prospective cohort of older adults, fish consumption was associated with very small differences in BMD and had no association with hip fracture risk.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of the consumption of dietary factors on the risk of breast cancer in a case-control study in Taiwan.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Two-hundred-and-fifty cases and 219 age-matched controls between the ages of 25 and 74 were interviewed in person between 1996 and 1999. Usual consumption of dietary habits including 100 foods was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and a nutrient database developed and validated in Taiwanese populations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Cases consumed significantly more fat than controls. Cases also consumed statistically significant less supplements such as vitamins and mineral than controls. Food group analyses showed that highest quartile of beef and pork intake significantly increased risk in younger women (OR = 2.5, 95{\%} CI = 1.0-6.0) and all women (OR = 2.5, 95{\%} CI = 1.1-3.3). The age- education- and total calorie-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of breast cancer risk comparing the highest and second highest quartile of fat intake to the lowest quartile was 5.1, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 2.1-13 and 3.5, 95{\%} CI: 1.4-8.7 among those younger cases ({\textless} or =40). A multiple regression model indicates a protective effect of supplements (OR: 0.40, 95{\%} CI: 0.3-07) and a harmful effect of dietary fat (OR: 2.6, 95{\%} CI: 1.4-5.0) for the highest versus lowest quartile in all women.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a strong protective effect of dietary supplements and a harmful effect of dietary fats on the risk of breast cancer among women in Taiwan. These findings should be confirmed in future follow-up studies. Specific amount of dietary supplements and dietary fats should be quantified for a more accurate evaluation on the risk for breast cancer in this population.},

abstract = {Metabolic modifications of tumor cells are hallmarks of cancer. They exhibit an altered metabolism that allows them to sustain higher proliferation rates in hostile environment outside the cell. In thyroid tumors, the expression of the estrogen-related receptor $\alpha$ (ERR$\alpha$), a major factor of metabolic adaptation, is closely related to the oxidative metabolism and the proliferative status of the cells. To elucidate the role played by ERR$\alpha$ in the glycolytic adaptation of tumor cells, we focused on the regulation of lactate dehydrogenases A and B (LDHA, LDHB) and the LDHA/LDHB ratio. Our study included tissue samples from 10 classical and 10 oncocytic variants of follicular thyroid tumors and 10 normal thyroid tissues, as well as samples from three human thyroid tumor cell lines: FTC-133, XTC.UC1 and RO82W-1. We identified multiple cis-acting promoter elements for ERR$\alpha$, in both the LDHA and LDHB genes. The interaction between ERR$\alpha$ and LDH promoters was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and in vitro analysis for LDHB. Using knock-in and knock-out cellular models, we found an inverse correlation between ERR$\alpha$ expression and LDH activity. This suggests that thyroid tumor cells may reprogram their metabolic pathways through the up-regulation of ERR$\alpha$ by a process distinct from that proposed by the recently revisited Warburg hypothesis.},

abstract = {cAMP is a second messenger that controls many key cellular functions. The only way to inactivate cAMP is to degrade it through the action of cAMP phosphodiesterases (PDEs). PDEs are thus poised to play a key regulatory role. PDE4 cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases appear to have specific functions with selective inhibitors serving as potent anti-inflammatory agents. The recent elucidation of the structure of the PDE4 catalytic unit allows for molecular insight into the mode of catalysis as well as substrate and inhibitor selectivity. The four PDE4 genes encode over 16 isoforms, each of which is characterized by a unique N-terminal region. PDE4 isoforms play a pivotal role in controlling functionally and spatially distinct pools of cAMP by virtue of their unique intracellular targeting. Targeting occurs by association with proteins, such as arrestins, SRC family tyrosyl kinases, A-kinase anchoring proteins ('AKAPs') and receptor for activated C kinase 1 ('RACK1'), and, in the case of isoform PDE4A1, by a specific interaction (TAPAS-1) with phosphatidic acid. PDE4 isoforms are 'designed' to be regulated by extracellular-signal-related protein kinase (ERK), which binds to anchor sites on the PDE4 catalytic domain that it phosphorylates. The upstream conserved region 1 (UCR1) and 2 (UCR2) modules that abut the PDE4 catalytic unit confer regulatory functions by orchestrating the functional outcome of phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase ('PKA') and ERK. PDE4 enzymes stand at a crossroads that allows them to integrate various signalling pathways with that of cAMP in spatially distinct compartments.},

Living in higher Hispanic density neighborhoods was generally associated with increased mortality, although associations differed slightly in magnitude and significance by ethnicity, birthplace, and neighborhood poverty. We found no evidence of an Immigrant Paradox and some evidence of a Hispanic Paradox where protective effects were limited to U.S.-born Hispanics. Contrary to prior studies, foreign birthplace and residence in higher Hispanic density neighborhoods were associated with increased mortality.

Setting Three centers involved in a population-based epidemiologic study of colon cancer. Subjects Men and women between the ages of 30 and 79 years. Results Quality-control results showed that 100{\%} of the computerized forms would be free of errors if the data were subjected to visual review only. Probing errors, which accounted for 47.3{\%} of all errors, were the most commonly encountered errors. In probing errors the interviewer did not probe in a nondirective manner, or the interviewer failed to verify responses that might be considered questionable. Applications The CARDIA diet history was computerized for use in epidemiologic studies of the association between diet and disease. Review of the audiotapes of the interviews showed that most errors made in obtaining a dietary assessment were not detectable from visual review of the data. Although the quality-control procedures were developed for a computerized diet history questionnaire, they are applicable to other dietary assessment methods. ?? 1994 The American Dietetic Association.},

Controls (n = 2,525) were frequency-matched by ethnicity and age (±5 years). Dietary intake, physical activity and other exposures were assessed using in-person interviews. Risk was assessed through multivariable and multinomial logistic regression with adjustment for relevant covariates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULT: While there was no overall association with breast cancer, the highest quartile of folate intake was marginally inversely associated with ER- breast cancer (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.50, 95{\%} CI 0.25-1.00, p for trend = 0.07).

abstract = {A case-control study of colorectal cancer, consisting of 157 cases and 380 controls matched by sex, ethnicity, decade of age and county of residence was performed to explore the associations between environmental exposure, metabolic polymorphisms and cancer risk. Participants were required to provide a blood sample, undergo caffeine phenotyping and complete an in-person interview that evaluated meat consumption, cooking methods and degree of doneness. A color atlas of foods cooked to different degrees of doneness was used to estimate food preparation techniques and food models were used to estimate serving portion sizes. Data was analyzed using a reference database of heterocyclic amine (HCA) exposure based on the food preferences chosen from the atlas. Data regarding individual food items cooked to different levels of doneness, as well as summary variables of foods and of food groups cooked to different degrees of doneness were also evaluated in a univariate analysis for association with colorectal cancer case status. Three measures of metabolic variation, hGSTA1 genotype, SULT1A1 genotype and the phenotype for CYP2A6 were also evaluated for possible association with colon cancer. While higher exposure to HCAs was strongly associated with colorectal cancer risk, increased consumption of five red meats cooked well done or very well done produced comparable odds ratios (OR) for colorectal cancer risk (OR=4.36, 95{\%} CI 2.08-9.60) for the highest quartile of exposure. Similarly, individuals in the most rapid CYP2A6 phenotype quartile showed an odds ratio (OR = 4.18, 95{\%} CI 2.03-8.90). The ORs for the low activity hGSTA1 and low activity SULT1A1 alleles were 2.0, 95{\%} CI 1.0-3.7 and 0.6, 95{\%} CI 0.3-1.1, respectively. Individual measures of specific HCAs provided little improvement in risk assessment over the measure of meat consumption, suggesting that exposure to other environmental or dietary carcinogens such as nitrosamines or undefined HCAs may contribute to colorectal cancer risk.},

We tested for effect modification by cooking methods (high- vs. low-temperature methods) and levels of doneness.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We observed that high white fish intake was associated with increased risk of advanced PCA among men who cooked with high-temperature methods (pan-frying, oven-broiling and grilling) until fish was well done (p (trend) = 0.001).

abstract = {The role of the consumption of fat, animal protein and vitamins on breast-cancer risk was investigated in a hospital-based case-control study of 924 patients (409 cases and 515 controls) in Montpellier (France). A dietary history questionnaire, administered by interview, comprising 55 key food items as well as beverage consumption, and including food frequencies and portion sizes, was used to measure the intake of total fat and its constituents, animal protein, retinol, beta-carotene, vitamin E and alcohol consumption. The questionnaire also elicited information on relevant medical history and personal characteristics. All food items which showed significantly elevated odds ratio (high-fat cheese, desserts and chocolate and processed pork meat) in a multivariate analysis contained a high proportion of animal fat. This is reflected in the nutrient analysis, which showed a significant linear trend as well as an elevated odds ratio for the highest tertile of consumption of total fat [OR3 = 1.6 (1.1-2.2)], animal fat [OR3 = 1.6 (1.1-2.2)], saturated fat [OR3 = 1.9 (1.3-2.6)] and mono-unsaturated fat [OR3 = 1.7 (1.2-2.5)]. For post-menopausal women, there is a particularly strong association with saturated fat [OR3 = 3.3 (1.4-7.8)] in a multivariate analysis including all other significant nutrients. There is no evidence of an increase of risk with the intake of animal protein and no evidence of risk reduction with increased consumption of vegetables, beta-carotene or vitamin E. Along with some recent studies, our results give support to the hypothesis that dietary fat is a risk factor in breast carcinogenesis.},

The task is an inverse problem in which we observe a set of SNP genotypes in a sample, typically using a genome-wide SNP microarray, and wish to infer the underlying haplotypes carried by the study individuals.

Here we present SHAPEIT2, a method that combines features of SHAPEIT1 and Impute2 (ref. 3) to substantially enhance performance. We use the SHAPEIT1 Markov model that represents the space of haplotypes consistent with a given individual's genotypes across a whole chromosome. The transition probabilities of this model are estimated by applying the Impute2 'surrogate family' phasing approach in local windows of size W. In each window, K informative haplotypes are chosen to update the transition probabilities of the Markov model. The method generalizes the Impute2 method so that it can be applied across a whole chromosome with linear computational scaling in K (Supplementary Methods). SHAPEIT2 uses multithreading so that multiple cores can be used to phase whole chromosomes, allowing users to make the best use of their computational resources.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although birthplace data are routinely collected in the participating Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries, such data are missing in a nonrandom manner for a large percentage of cases. This hinders analysis of nativity-related cancer disparities. In the current study, the authors evaluated multiple imputation of nativity status among Hispanic patients diagnosed with cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer and demonstrated the effect of multiple imputation on apparent nativity disparities in survival.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Multiple imputation by logistic regression was used to generate nativity values (US-born vs foreign-born) using a priori-defined variables. The accuracy of the method was evaluated among a subset of cases. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to illustrate the effect of imputation by comparing survival among US-born and foreign-born Hispanics, with and without imputation of nativity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Birthplace was missing for 31{\%}, 49{\%}, and 39{\%}, respectively, of cases of cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer. The sensitivity of the imputation strategy for detecting foreign-born status was ≥ 90{\%} and the specificity was ≥ 86{\%}. The agreement between the true and imputed values was ≥ 0.80 and the misclassification error was ≤ 10{\%}. Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated different associations between nativity and survival when nativity was imputed versus when cases with missing birthplace were omitted from the analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Multiple imputation using variables available in the SEER data file can be used to accurately detect foreign-born status. This simple strategy may help researchers to disaggregate analyses by nativity and uncover important nativity disparities in regard to cancer diagnosis, treatment, and survival.

abstract = {Animal studies have in general, been supportive of a protective effect of fish and fish (n-3) PUFA against breast cancer risk; but the epidemiologic evidence of such a relationship is limited. Case-control and cohort studies have rarely shown significant associations. The association between total fish intake and the effect of fat content and preparation method of the fish, in relation to the incidence rate ratios of breast cancer, were investigated among postmenopausal women. We also investigated the effect of fish intake with respect to estrogen receptor expression of breast cancer tumors. A total of 23,693 postmenopausal women from the prospective study "Diet, Cancer and Health" were included in the study. During follow-up, 424 women were diagnosed with breast cancer. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95{\%} CI per each additional 25 g of mean daily intake of fish were 1.13 (CI, 1.03-1.23). Analysis of fatty fish gave IRR of 1.11 (CI, 0.91-1.34), and the result for lean fish was 1.13 (CI, 0.99-1.29). When fish intake was stratified into three types of preparation methods, the IRR for fried fish was 1.09 (CI, 0.95-1.25), for boiled fish 1.09 (CI, 0.85-1.42), and for processed fish 1.12 (CI, 0.93-1.34). The IRR per additional 25 g of mean daily intake of fish was 1.14 (CI, 1.03-1.26) for estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and 1.00 (CI, 0.81-1.24) for estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer. In conclusion, this study showed that higher intakes of fish were significantly associated with higher incidence rates of breast cancer. The association was present only for development of ER+ breast cancer.},

abstract = {The conventional method of detecting gene-environment interactions, the case-control analysis, suffers from low statistical power. In contrast, the case-only analysis/design can be powerful in certain scenarios, although violation of the assumption of independence between the genetic and environmental factors can greatly bias the results. As an alternative, Bayes model averaging may be used to combine the case-control and case-only analyses. This approach first frames the case-control and case-only analyses as variations of a log-linear model. The weighting between these 2 models is then a function of the data and prior beliefs on the independence of the 2 potentially interacting factors. In this paper, the authors demonstrate via simulations that when there is no prior information on the independence of the genetic and environmental factors, this approach tends to be more powerful than the case-control analysis. Additionally, when the genetic and environmental factors are not independent in the population, bias is substantially reduced, with a corresponding reduction in type I error in comparison with the case-only analysis. Increased power or increased robustness to violations of the independence assumption may be obtained with more appropriate prior specification. The authors use an example data analysis to demonstrate the advantages of this approach.},

abstract = {Several methods for screening gene-environment interaction have recently been proposed that address the issue of using gene-environment independence in a data-adaptive way. In this report, the authors present a comparative simulation study of power and type I error properties of 3 classes of procedures: 1) the standard 1-step case-control method; 2) the case-only method that requires an assumption of gene-environment independence for the underlying population; and 3) a variety of hybrid methods, including empirical-Bayes, 2-step, and model averaging, that aim at gaining power by exploiting the assumption of gene-environment independence and yet can protect against false positives when the independence assumption is violated. These studies suggest that, although the case-only method generally has maximum power, it has the potential to create substantial false positives in large-scale studies even when a small fraction of markers are associated with the exposure under study in the underlying population. All the hybrid methods perform well in protecting against such false positives and yet can retain substantial power advantages over standard case-control tests. The authors conclude that, for future genome-wide scans for gene-environment interactions, major power gain is possible by using alternatives to standard case-control analysis. Whether a case-only type scan or one of the hybrid methods should be used depends on the strength and direction of gene-environment interaction and association, the level of tolerance for false positives, and the nature of replication strategies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate estimates of cancer survival are important for assessing optimal patient care and prognosis. Evaluation of these estimates via relative survival (a ratio of observed and expected survival rates) requires a population life table that is matched to the cancer population by age, sex, race and/or ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and ideally risk factors for the cancer under examination. Because life tables for all subgroups in a study may be unavailable, we investigated whether cause-specific survival could be used as an alternative for relative survival. METHODS: We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program for 2,330,905 cancer patients from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 2004. We defined cancer-specific deaths according to the following variables: cause of death, only one tumor or the first of multiple tumors, site of the original cancer diagnosis, and comorbidities. Estimates of relative survival and cause-specific survival that were derived by use of an actuarial method were compared. RESULTS: Among breast cancer patients who were white, black, or of Asian or Pacific Islander descent and who were older than 65 years, estimates of 5-year relative survival (107.5{\%}, 106.6{\%}, and 103.0{\%}, respectively) were higher than estimates of 5-year cause-specific survival (98.6{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 98.4{\%} to 98.8{\%}; 97.4{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 96.2{\%} to 98.2{\%}; and 99.2{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 98.4{\%}, 99.6{\%}, respectively). Relative survival methods likely underestimated rates for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (eg, for white cancer patients aged ≥65 years, relative survival = 54.2{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 53.1{\%} to 55.3{\%}, and cause-specific survival = 60.1{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 59.1{\%} to 60.9{\%}) and the lung and bronchus (eg, for black cancer patients aged ≥65 years, relative survival = 10.5{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 9.9{\%} to 11.2{\%}, and cause-specific survival = 11.9{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 11.2 {\%} to 12.6{\%}), largely because of mismatches between the population with these diseases and the population used to derive the life table. Socioeconomic differences between groups with low and high status in relative survival estimates appeared to be inflated (eg, corpus and uterus socioeconomic status gradient was 13.3{\%} by relative survival methods and 8.8{\%} by cause-specific survival methods). CONCLUSION: Although accuracy of the cause of death on a death certificate can be problematic for cause-specific survival estimates, cause-specific survival methods may be an alternative to relative survival methods when suitable life tables are not available.},

This article discusses different criteria for error control in resampling-based multiple testing, including (a) the family wise error rate of Westfall and Young (1993) and (b) the false discovery rate developed by Benjamini and Hochberg (1995), both from a frequentist viewpoint; and (c) the positive false discovery rate of Storey (2002a), which has a Bayesian motivation. We also introduce our recently developed fast algorithm for implementing the minP adjustment to control family-wise error rate. Adjusted p-values for different approaches are applied to gene expression data from two recently published microarray studies. The properties of these procedures for multiple testing are compared.},

abstract = {Large exploratory studies are often characterized by a preponderance of true null hypotheses, with a small though multiple number of false hypotheses. Traditional multiple-test adjustments consider either each hypothesis separately, or all hypotheses simultaneously, but it may be more desirable to consider the combined evidence for subsets of hypotheses, in order to reduce the number of hypotheses to a manageable size. Previously, Zaykin et al. ([2002] Genet. Epidemiol. 22:170-185) proposed forming the product of all P-values at less than a preset threshold, in order to combine evidence from all significant tests. Here we consider a complementary strategy: form the product of the K most significant P-values. This has certain advantages for genomewide association scans: K can be chosen on the basis of a hypothesised disease model, and is independent of sample size. Furthermore, the alternative hypothesis corresponds more closely to the experimental situation where all loci have fixed effects. We give the distribution of the rank truncated product and suggest some methods to account for correlated tests in genomewide scans. We show that, under realistic scenarios, it provides increased power to detect genomewide association, while identifying a candidate set of good quality and fixed size for follow-up studies.},

Bone mineral density (BMD) is a useful surrogate marker for risk of fracture and is a highly heritable trait.

Allele frequencies were estimated in contrasting DNA pools from white females selected for low ({\textless}0.87 g/cm2, n = 319) and high ({\textgreater} 1.11 g/cm2, n = 321) BMD at the lumbar spine. Significant findings were verified in two additional sample collections.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Based on allele frequency differences between DNA pools and subsequent individual genotyping, one of the candidate loci indicated was the phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) gene region on chromosome 5q12. We subsequently tested the marker SNP, rs1498608, in a second sample of 138 white females with low ({\textless}0.91 g/cm2) and 138 females with high ({\textgreater}1.04 g/cm2) lumbar spine BMD. Odds ratios were 1.5 (P = 0.035) in the original sample and 2.1 (P = 0.018) in the replication sample. Association fine mapping with 80 SNPs located within 50 kilobases of the marker SNP identified a 20 kilobase region of association containing exon 6 of PDE4D. In a second, family-based replication sample with a preponderance of females with low BMD, rs1498608 showed an opposite relationship with BMD at different sites (p = 0.00044-0.09). We also replicated the previously reported association of the Ser37Ala polymorphism in BMP2, known to interact biologically with PDE4D, with BMD.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This study indicates that variants in the gene encoding PDE4D account for some of the genetic contribution to bone mineral density variation in humans. The contrasting results from different samples indicate that the effect may be context-dependent. PDE4 inhibitors have been shown to increase bone mass in normal and osteopenic mice, but up until now there have been no reports implicating any member of the PDE4 gene family in human osteoporosis.},

We describe a method that enables explicit detection and correction of population stratification on a genome-wide scale. Our method uses principal components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls. The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker's variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations. Our simple, efficient approach can easily be applied to disease studies with hundreds of thousands of markers.},

abstract = {The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been implicated in breast carcinogenesis. However, there has been no large-scale investigation of genetic variants in the mTOR pathway and breast cancer risk. We examined 28847 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 61 mTOR pathway genes in the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk consortium of 3663 cases [1983 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and 1098 ER-negative (ER-)] and 4687 controls. Gene-level analyses were conducted using the adaptive rank truncated product (ARTP) test for 10773 SNPs that were not highly correlated (r (2) {\textless} 0.8), and SNP-level analyses were conducted with logistic regression. Among genes that were prioritized (nominal P {\textless} 0.05, ARTP tests), associations were observed for intronic SNPs TSC2 rs181088346 [odds ratio (OR) of each copy of variant allele = 0.77, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.65-0.88 for all breast cancer] and BRAF rs114729114 (OR = 1.53, 95{\%} CI = 1.24-1.91 for all breast cancer and OR = 2.03, 95{\%} CI = 1.50-2.76 for ER- tumors). For ER- tumors, intronic SNPs PGF rs11542848 (OR = 1.38, 95{\%} CI = 1.15-1.66) and rs61759375 (OR = 1.34, 95{\%} CI = 1.14-1.57) and MAPK3 rs78564187 (OR = 1.26, 95{\%} CI = 1.11-1.43) were associated with increased risk. These SNPs were significant at a gene-wide level (Bonferroni-corrected P {\textless} 0.05). The variant allele of RPS6KB2 rs35363135, a synonymous coding SNP, was more likely to be observed in ER- than ER+ tumors (OR = 1.18, 95{\%} CI = 1.05-1.31, gene-wide Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.06).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic association studies using case-control designs are susceptible to false-positive and false-negative results if there are differences in genetic ancestry between cases and controls. We measured genetic ancestry among Latinas in a population-based case-control study of breast cancer and tested the association between ancestry and known breast cancer risk factors. We reasoned that if genetic ancestry is associated with known breast cancer risk factors, then the results of genetic association studies would be confounded. METHODS: We used 44 ancestry informative markers to estimate individuals' genetic ancestry in 563 Latina participants. To test whether ancestry is a predictor of hormone therapy use, parity, and body mass index (BMI), we used multivariate logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI) associated with a 25{\%} increase in Indigenous American ancestry, adjusting for age, education, and the participant's and grandparents' place of birth. RESULTS: Hormone therapy use was significantly less common among women with higher Indigenous American ancestry (OR, 0.78; 95{\%} CI, 0.63-0.96). Higher Indigenous American ancestry was also significantly associated with overweight (BMI, 25-29.9 versus {\textless}25) and obesity (BMI, {\textgreater} or =30 versus {\textless}25), but only among foreign-born Latina women (OR, 3.44; 95{\%} CI, 1.97-5.99 and OR, 1.95; 95{\%} CI, 1.24-3.06, respectively). CONCLUSION: Some breast cancer risk factors are associated with genetic ancestry among Latinas in the San Francisco Bay Area. Therefore, case-control genetic association studies for breast cancer should directly measure genetic ancestry to avoid potential confounding},

Tumour-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) are abundantly present in the tumour milieu and here trigger and perpetrate a state of chronic inflammation which ultimately supports disease development and contributes to an immune-suppressive environment. Therapeutic strategies to limit inflammatory cells and their products have been successful in pre-clinical tumour models. Early clinical trials with specific cytokine and chemokine inhibitors, or with strategies designed to target TAMs, are on their way in different solid malignancies. Partial clinical responses and stabilization of diseases were observed in some patients, in the absence of significant toxicity.

We investigated the association between vitamin D intake and breast cancer in a population-based case-control study of 1,527 NHW and 791 Hispanic breast cancer cases diagnosed in 1999-2004 in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado, and 1,599 NHW and 922 Hispanic age-matched controls. Vitamin D intake was assessed using food frequency questionnaires, and associations with breast cancer were adjusted for age, ethnicity, state, education, body mass index, smoking, age at menarche, age at first birth, parity, hormone exposure, height, and physical activity using logistic regression. BsmI, Poly A and FokI vitamin D receptor (VDR) genotypes were also measured. Dietary vitamin D intake was positively associated with breast cancer (highest vs. lowest quartile (Q (4) vs. Q (1)): odds ratio (OR) = 1.35, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 1.15-1.60; P (trend) = 0.003), whereas vitamin D supplement use was inversely associated with breast cancer (10+ $\mu$g/day vs. none: OR = 0.79, 95{\%} CI = 0.65-0.96, P (trend) = 0.01). Similar patterns in risk were observed by ethnicity and menopausal status. Positive associations with dietary vitamin D intake and inverse associations with supplement use were observed for ER+/PR+ and ER-/PR- breast cancers, but not for ER+/PR- disease. BsmI genotype significantly modified the association between dietary vitamin D and breast cancer overall.

It incorporates specific predictions from past researchers on the mechanism of carcinogenesis by methyl-substituted hydrocarbons, including (1) requirement for metabolism to an ArCH2X type structure where X is a good leaving group and (2) biological substitution of a meso-methyl group at the most reactive center in non-methylated hydrocarbons. The Theory incorporates strong inferences of Fieser: (1) The mechanism of carcinogenesis involves a specific metabolic substitution of a hydrocarbon at its most reactive center and (2) Metabolic elimination of a carcinogen is a detoxifying process competitive with that of carcinogenesis and occurring by a different mechanism. According to this outlook, chemical or biochemical substitution of a methyl group at the reactive meso-position of non-methylated hydrocarbons is the first step in the mechanism of carcinogenesis for most, if not all, PAHs and the most potent metabolites of PAHs are to be found among the meso methyl-substituted hydrocarbons. Some PAHs and their known or potential metabolites and closely related compounds have been tested in rats for production of sarcomas at the site of subcutaneous injection and the results strongly support the specific predictions of the Unified Theory.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Knowledge on specific biological pathways mediating disease occurrence (e.g., inflammation) may be utilized to construct hypotheses-driven dietary patterns that take advantage of current evidence on disease-related hypotheses and the statistical methods of a posteriori patterns. OBJECTIVE We developed and validated an empirical dietary inflammatory index (EDII) based on food groups. METHODS We entered 39 pre-defined food groups in reduced rank regression models followed by stepwise linear regression analyses in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS, n = 5230) to identify a dietary pattern most predictive of 3 plasma inflammatory markers: interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ receptor 2 (TNF$\alpha$R2). We evaluated the construct validity of the EDII in 2 independent samples from NHS-II (n = 1002) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS, n = 2632) using multivariable-adjusted linear regression models to examine how well the EDII predicted concentrations of IL-6, CRP, TNF$\alpha$R2, adiponectin, and an overall inflammatory marker score combining all biomarkers. RESULTS The EDII is the weighted sum of 18 food groups; 9 are anti-inflammatory and 9 proinflammatory. In NHS-II and HPFS, the EDII significantly predicted concentrations of all biomarkers. For example, the relative concentrations comparing extreme EDII quintiles in NHS-II were: adiponectin, 0.88 (95{\%} CI, 0.80, 0.96), P-trend = 0.003; and CRP, 1.52 (95{\%} CI, 1.18, 1.97), P-trend = 0.002. Corresponding associations in HPFS were: 0.87 (95{\%} CI, 0.82, 0.92), P-trend {\textless} 0.0001; and 1.23 (95{\%} CI, 1.09, 1.40), P-trend = 0.002. CONCLUSION The EDII represents, to our knowledge, a novel, hypothesis-driven, empirically derived dietary pattern that assesses diet quality based on its inflammatory potential. Its strong construct validity in independent samples of women and men indicates its usefulness in assessing the inflammatory potential of whole diets. Additionally, the EDII may be calculated in a standardized and reproducible manner across different populations thus circumventing a major limitation of dietary patterns derived from the same study in which they are applied.},

abstract = {Asbestos exposure is a known risk factor for lung cancer. Although recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified some novel loci for lung cancer risk, few addressed genome-wide gene-environment interactions. To determine gene-asbestos interactions in lung cancer risk, we conducted genome-wide gene-environment interaction analyses at levels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genes and pathways, using our published Texas lung cancer GWAS dataset. This dataset included 317 498 SNPs from 1154 lung cancer cases and 1137 cancer-free controls. The initial SNP-level P-values for interactions between genetic variants and self-reported asbestos exposure were estimated by unconditional logistic regression models with adjustment for age, sex, smoking status and pack-years. The P-value for the most significant SNP rs13383928 was 2.17×10(-6), which did not reach the genome-wide statistical significance. Using a versatile gene-based test approach, we found that the top significant gene was C7orf54, located on 7q32.1 (P = 8.90×10(-5)). Interestingly, most of the other significant genes were located on 11q13. When we used an improved gene-set-enrichment analysis approach, we found that the Fas signaling pathway and the antigen processing and presentation pathway were most significant (nominal P {\textless} 0.001; false discovery rate {\textless} 0.05) among 250 pathways containing 17 572 genes. We believe that our analysis is a pilot study that first describes the gene-asbestos interaction in lung cancer risk at levels of SNPs, genes and pathways. Our findings suggest that immune function regulation-related pathways may be mechanistically involved in asbestos-associated lung cancer risk.},

abstract = {High intake of red meat has been associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer in Western countries. There has been much interest in the role of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in colorectal cancer prevention, but epidemiological findings are limited and inconsistent. The objective of our study was to examine associations of meat, fish and fat intake with risk of colorectal cancer, paying particular attention to the subsite within the colorectum. Data were from the Fukuoka Colorectal Cancer Study, a population-based case-control study, covering 782 cases and 793 controls. Diet was assessed by interview, using newly developed personal-computer software for registering semiquantitative food frequencies. The intake of beef/pork, processed meat, total fat, saturated fat or n-6 PUFA showed no clear association with the overall or subsite-specific risk of colorectal cancer. There was an almost significant inverse association between n-3 PUFA and the risk of colorectal cancer; the covariate-adjusted odds ratio for the highest (median 3.94 g/day) versus lowest (median 1.99 g/day) quintile of energy-adjusted intake was 0.74 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.52-1.06, trend P=0.050). The consumption of fish and fish products was similarly inversely related to the risk although the association was not statistically significant. These associations were more evident for distal colon cancer; adjusted odds ratio for the highest versus lowest quintile of n-3 PUFA intake was 0.56 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.34-0.92, trend P=0.02). Our findings do not support the hypothesis that consumption of red meat increases colorectal cancer risk but do suggest that high intake of fish may decrease the risk, particularly of distal colon cancer.},

abstract = {The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases. Their primary function is degradation of proteins in the extracellular matrix. Currently, at least 19 members of this family are known to exist. Based on substrate specificity and domain organization, the MMPs can be loosely divided into four main groups: the interstitial collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins and membrane-type MMPs. Recent data from model systems suggest that MMPs are involved in breast cancer initiation, invasion and metastasis. Consistent with their role in breast cancer progression, high levels of at least two MMPs (MMP-2 and stromelysin-3) have been found to correlate with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Because MMPs are apparently involved in breast cancer initiation and dissemination, inhibition of these proteinases may be of value both in preventing breast cancer and in blocking metastasis of established tumours},

abstract = {This paper considers quantitatively the extent to which the interaction or confounding effects of covariates may influence the design of case-control studies with particular reference to sample size requirements and the role of matching. For the most part, attention is confined to a dichotomous exposure variable, and a single dichotomous covariate. Adjustment for confounding variables appears to have little effect on the power of a study unless they are strongly (odds ratio of 5 or more) related to both the disease and the exposure of interest, and only in similar circumstances will matching be of appreciable value. Matching also makes only a small improvement in the power to detect interaction effects, except under fairly extreme conditions. Both to control confounding and to detect interaction, the effect of matching may sometimes be to reduce the power of a study. The difference in power between matched and unmatched studies diminishes rapidly as the control-to-case ratio is increased. The implications of interaction effects for sample size requirements are more important. If one aim of a study is to detect interactions, the size of the study will have to be at least four times larger than if attention were confined to detecting main effects of the same magnitude. These conclusions are based on a quantitative evaluation of a wide range of possible situations.},

METHODS: The authors have immunohistochemically studied estrogen receptors (ER) in papillary thyroid carcinoma in women. Two anti-ER monoclonal antibodies, D5 and H222, were used. The authors then investigated the responsiveness to estrogen of thyroid neoplasms using primary culture of surgically resected thyroid tissues. The proliferative activity of cultured cells was measured by the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling index (LI). RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of the specimens (18/70) showed positive staining with D5, but only 5.6{\%} of the specimens (2/36) showed positive staining with H222. The BrdU LI of ER-positive papillary thyroid carcinoma increased with the addition of estradiol. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that estrogen may affect the proliferation of ER-positive papillary thyroid carcinoma.},

We conducted a case-control study including 582 women with breast cancer and 1,569 controls free of breast cancer selected from participants in the Nurses' Health Study and the Nurses' Health Study II. Information concerning childhood diet of the nurses at ages 3-5 years was obtained from the mothers of the participants with a 30-item food-frequency questionnaire. An increased risk of breast cancer was observed among woman who had frequently consumed French fries at preschool age. For one additional serving of French fries per week, the odds ratio (OR) for breast cancer adjusted for adult life breast cancer risk factors was 1.27 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.12-1.44). Consumption of whole milk was associated with a slightly decreased risk of breast cancer (covariate-adjusted OR for every additional glass of milk per day = 0.90; 95{\%} CI = 0.82-0.99). Intake of none of the nutrients calculated was related to the risk of breast cancer risk in this study. These data suggest a possible association between diet before puberty and the subsequent risk of breast cancer. Differential recall of preschool diet by the mothers of cases and controls has to be considered as a possible explanation for the observed associations. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the association between preschool diet and breast cancer is reproducible in prospective data not subject to recall bias.},

abstract = {Arylamines (AAs) and heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) are structurally related carcinogens formed during the combustion of tobacco or cooking of meat. They undergo cytochrome P450 mediated N-hydroxylation to form metabolites which bind to DNA and lead to mutations. The N-hydroxylated metabolites of many AAs also can undergo a co-oxidation reaction with oxy-hemolgobin (HbO2) to form methemoglobin (met-Hb) and the arylnitroso intermediates, which react with the beta-Cys(93) chain of Hb to form Hb-arylsulfinamide adducts. The biochemistry of arylamine metabolism has been exploited to biomonitor certain AAs through their Hb arylsulfinamide adducts in humans. We examined the reactivity of HbO2 with the N-hydroxylated metabolites of 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP, HONH-ABP), aniline (ANL, HONH-ANL), and the HAAs 2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (AalphaC, HONH-AalphaC), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP, HONH-PhIP), and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx, HONH-MeIQx). HONH-ABP, HO-ANL, and HONH-AalphaC induced methemoglobinemia and formed Hb sulfinamide adducts. However, HONH-MeIQx and HONH-PhIP did not react with the oxy-heme complex, and met-Hb formation and chemical modification of the beta-Cys(93) residue were negligible. Molecular modeling studies showed that the distances between the H-ON-AA or H-ON-HAA substrates and the oxy-heme complex of HbO2 were too far away to induce methemoglobinemia. Different conformational changes in flexible helical and loop regions around the heme pocket induced by the H-ON-AA or H-ON-HAAs may explain the different proclivities of these chemicals to induce methemoglobinemia. Hb-Cys(93beta) sulfinamide and sulfonamide adducts of ABP, ANL, and AalphaC were identified, by Orbitrap MS, following the proteolysis of Hb with trypsin, Glu-C, or Lys-C. Hb sulfinamide and sulfonamide adducts of ABP were identified in the blood of mice exposed to ABP, by Orbitrap MS. This is the first report of the identification of intact Hb sulfinamide adducts of carcinogenic AAs in vivo. The high reactivity of HONH-AalphaC with HbO2 suggests that the Hb sulfinamide adduct of AalphaC may be a promising biomarker of exposure to this HAA in humans.},

A population-based case-control study was conducted including 706 cases and 1,381 controls. In addition to a risk factor questionnaire, a subgroup of 355 cases and 838 controls completed a food frequency questionnaire. Breast cancer risk was inversely associated with vegetable consumption (P for trend = 0.034). The odds ratio for the fourth quartile of vegetable intake compared with the first quartile was 0.64 (95{\%} confidence interval = 0.43-0.96). Breast cancer risk increased with a higher consumption of red meat (P for trend = 0.016); women with the highest consumption level had an 85{\%} elevated breast cancer risk compared with the lowest quartile (95{\%} confidence interval = 1.23-2.78). When only premenopausal women were considered, the protective effect of vegetable intake and the positive association with meat intake were even stronger. These results are compatible with the international recommendations for a breast cancer-preventive diet and suggest that the favorable effect of a diet high in vegetables and low in red meat, especially beef, may be stronger in premenopausal women.},

This study supports a modest association between a variant in IL6 and breast cancer among older women and TNF-related variants and breast cancer among middle-aged women. Further evaluation of these genes in other studies is warranted.},

abstract = {As one of the main extra-hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, CYP1A1 has been comprehensively investigated for its ability to metabolize both exogenous and endogenous compounds into their carcinogenic derivatives. These derivatives are linked to cancer initiation and progression. The compound benzo-a-pyrene (BaP), a copious and noxious compound present in coal tar, automobile exhaust fumes, cigarette smoke and charbroiled food, is metabolised by CYP1A1 and has been studied in great detail. Other compounds reliant on the same enzyme for their activation include 7,12 dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and heterocyclic amine, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP). This review takes an in-depth look at a number of phytochemicals, plant extracts and a few synthetic compounds that have been researched and deemed potential chemopreventives via their interaction with the activity and expression of CYP1A1. It will also review a useful active site model of CYP1A1. Based on inhibitors of CYP1A1 that have demonstrated in vivo use as chemopreventors, CYP1A1 is a useful initial target for screening compounds with such potential, with the use of rapid in vitro and/or in silico assessments. Chemoprevention is a means by which healthy tissues are protected via the prevention, inhibition or reversal of carcinogenesis. This review focuses on one important pathway of carcinogenesis and identifies the important role that CYP1A1 plays in that pathway. It is hoped that highlighting the importance of such a key target, will help revive further research into and application of inhibitors of CYP1A1 towards generating improved chemopreventors.

abstract = {Context: Gene expression analysis has identified several breast cancer subtypes, including basal-like, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positive/estrogen receptor negative (HER2+/ER-), luminal A, and luminal B. Objectives: To determine population-based distributions and clinical associations for breast cancer subtypes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Immunohistochemical surrogates for each subtype were applied to 496 incident cases of invasive breast cancer from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (ascertained between May 1993 and December 1996), a population-based, case-control study that oversampled premenopausal and African American women. Subtype definitions were as follows: luminal A (ER+ and/or progesterone receptor positive [PR+], HER2-), luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+, HER2+), basal-like (ER-, PR-, HER2-, cytokeratin 5/6 positive, and/or HER1+), HER2+/ER- (ER-, PR-, and HER2+), and unclassified (negative for all 5 markers). Main Outcome Measures: We examined the prevalence of breast cancer subtypes within racial and menopausal subsets and determined their associations with tumor size, axillary nodal status, mitotic index, nuclear pleomorphism, combined grade, p53 mutation status, and breast cancer-specific survival. Results The basal-like breast cancer subtype was more prevalent among premenopausal African American women (39{\%}) compared with postmenopausal African American women (14{\%}) and non-African American women (16{\%}) of any age (P{\textless}.001), whereas the luminal A subtype was less prevalent (36{\%} vs 59{\%} and 54{\%}, respectively). The HER2+/ER- subtype did not vary with race or menopausal status (6{\%}-9{\%}). Compared with luminal A, basal-like tumors had more TP53 mutations (44{\%} vs 15{\%}, P{\textless}.001), higher mitotic index (odds ratio [OR], 11.0; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 5.6-21.7), more marked nuclear pleomorphism (OR, 9.7; 95{\%} CI, 5.3-18.0), and higher combined grade (OR, 8.3; 95{\%} CI, 4.4-15.6). Breast cancer-specific survival differed by subtype (P{\textless}.001), with shortest survival among HER2+/ER- and basal-like subtypes. Conclusions: Basal-like breast tumors occurred at a higher prevalence among premenopausal African American patients compared with postmenopausal African American and non-African American patients in this population-based study. A higher prevalence of basal-like breast tumors and a lower prevalence of luminal A tumors could contribute to the poor prognosis of young African American women with breast cancer. 2006 American Medical Association.

abstract = {Cooking meats at high temperatures and for long duration produces heterocyclic amines and other mutagens. These meat-derived mutagenic compounds have been hypothesized to increase risk of colorectal neoplasia, but prospective data are unavailable. We examined the association between intakes of the heterocyclic amines 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5,-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5,-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx), and meat-derived mutagenicity (MDM) and risk of distal colon adenoma using a cooking method questionnaire administered in 1996 in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study cohort. Between 1996 and 2002, 581 distal colon adenoma cases were identified. Higher intake of MDM was marginally associated with increased risk of distal adenoma [fourth versus lowest quintile: odds ratio (OR), 1.39; 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI), 1.05-1.84; highest versus lowest quintile: OR, 1.29; 95{\%} CI, 0.97-1.72; P(trend) = 0.08]. Adjusting for total red meat or processed meat intake did not explain those associations. Our data also suggested a positive association between higher MeIQx (highest versus lowest quintile: OR, 1.28; 95{\%} CI, 0.95-1.71; P(trend) = 0.22) and risk of adenoma, but this association was attenuated after adjusting for processed meat intake. DiMeIQx and PhIP did not seem to be associated with risk of adenoma. In conclusion, higher consumption of mutagens from meats cooked at higher temperature and longer duration may be associated with higher risk of distal colon adenoma independent of overall meat intake. Because mutagens other than heterocyclic amines also contribute to MDM, our results suggest that mutagens other than heterocyclic amines in cooked meats may also play a role in increasing the risk of distal adenoma.},

A number of factors likely contribute to these trends including rising rates of obesity and diabetes across the globe and differences in genetic predisposition. Here, we emphasize Hispanic populations and summarize what is currently known about obesity, diabetes and individual genetic predisposition as they relate to ethnic disparities in breast cancer incidence and mortality. In addition, we discuss potential contributions to breast cancer aetiology from molecular mechanisms associated with obesity and diabetes including dyslipidemia, hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, endocrine dysfunction and inflammation. We propose that unique differences in diet and lifestyle coupled with individual genetic predisposition and endocrine/immune dysfunction explain most of the ethnic disparities seen in breast cancer incidence and mortality.},

abstract = {Both epidemiological and experimental findings suggest the possible roles of sex steroids in the pathogenesis and/or development of various human thyroid disorders. In this study, we evaluated the expression of estrogen receptors (ER) alpha and beta in normal thyroid glands (N = 25; female: n = 13, male: n = 10, unknown: n = 2) ranging in age from fetus to adult. Furthermore, using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the expression of ERalpha and beta in 206 cases of thyroid disorders, including 24 adenomatous goiters, 23 follicular adenomas, and 159 thyroid carcinomas. In addition, we also studied the mRNA expression of ERalpha and beta and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 1 and 2, enzymes involved in the interconversion between estrone and estradiol, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in 48 of these 206 cases (10 adenomatous goiters, 10 follicular adenomas, and 28 papillary thyroid carcinomas) in which fresh frozen tissues were available for examination to further elucidate the possible involvement of intracrine estrogen metabolism and/or actions in thyroid disorders. ERalpha labeling index, or percentage of cells immunopositive for ERalpha, was significantly higher in adenomatous goiter (14.2 +/- 6.4), follicular adenoma (13.4 +/- 5.1), and thyroid carcinoma (16.4 +/- 2.1) than in normal thyroid gland (0; P {\textless}.05). Few follicular cells were positive for ERalpha in normal thyroid glands. In papillary carcinoma, ERalpha labeling index was significantly higher in premenopausal women (28.1 +/- 4.5) than in postmenopausal women (14.2 +/- 2.9) and in men of various ages (7.6 +/- 2.7; P {\textless}.05). In other histological types of thyroid carcinoma, no significant correlations were detected. ERbeta immunoreactivity was detected in both follicular and C-cells of normal thyroid glands, including those in developing fetal thyroid glands. In addition, ERbeta immunoreactivity was detected in the nuclei of various thyroid lesions. But no significant correlations were detected between ERbeta labeling index and clinicopathological findings including age, menopausal status, gender, and/or histological type of thyroid lesions. 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 1 expression was detected in 31/48 (64.0{\%}) of the cases examined, whereas Type 2 was detected only in 3/46 (6.3{\%}) of all the cases examined. These results demonstrated that estrogens may influence the development, physiology, and pathology of human thyroid glands, and these effects, especially through ERalpha, may become more pronounced in neoplasms, particularly in papillary carcinoma arising in premenopausal women.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Family studies have served as a cornerstone of genetic research on colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Colorectal Cancer Family Registry (Colon CFR) is an international consortium of six centers in North America and Australia formed as a resource to support studies on the etiology, prevention, and clinical management of colorectal cancer. Differences in design and sampling schemes ensures a resource that covers the continuum of disease risk. Two separate recruitment strategies identified colorectal cancer cases: population-based (incident case probands identified by cancer registries; all six centers) and clinic-based (families with multiple cases of colorectal cancer presenting at cancer family clinics; three centers). At this time, the Colon CFR is in year 10 with the second phase of enrollment nearly complete. In phase I recruitment (1998-2002), population-based sampling ranged from all incident cases of colorectal cancer to a subsample based on age at diagnosis and/or family cancer history. During phase II (2002-2007), population-based recruitment targeted cases diagnosed before the age of 50 years are more likely attributable to genetic factors. Standardized protocols were used to collect information regarding family cancer history and colorectal cancer risk factors, and biospecimens were obtained to assess microsatellite instability (MSI) status, expression of mismatch repair proteins, and other molecular and genetic processes. RESULTS: Of the 8,369 case probands enrolled to date, 2,602 reported having one or more colorectal cancer-affected relatives and 799 met the Amsterdam I criteria for Lynch syndrome. A large number of affected (1,324) and unaffected (19,816) relatives were enrolled, as were population-based (4,108) and spouse (983) controls. To date, 91{\%} of case probands provided blood (or, for a few, buccal cell) samples and 75{\%} provided tumor tissue. For a selected sample of high-risk subjects, lymphocytes have been immortalized. Nearly 600 case probands had more than two affected colorectal cancer relatives, and 800 meeting the Amsterdam I criteria and 128, the Amsterdam II criteria. MSI testing for 10 markers was attempted on all obtained tumors. Of the 4,011 tumors collected in phase I that were successfully tested, 16{\%} were MSI-high, 12{\%} were MSI-low, and 72{\%} were microsatellite stable. Tumor tissues from clinic-based cases were twice as likely as population-based cases to be MSI-high (34{\%} versus 17{\%}). Seventeen percent of phase I proband tumors and 24{\%} of phase II proband tumors had some loss of mismatch repair protein, with the prevalence depending on sampling. Active follow-up to update personal and family histories, new neoplasms, and deaths in probands and relatives is nearly complete. CONCLUSIONS: The Colon CFR supports an evolving research program that is broad and interdisciplinary. The greater scientific community has access to this large and well-characterized resource for studies of colorectal cancer.},

Subset-based meta-analysis was used to account for possible disease heterogeneity, and hierarchical modeling was employed to estimate the effect of the subcomponents within the inflammation pathway. The network was visualized by enrichment map. All statistical tests were two-sided.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We identified three pleiotropic loci within the inflammation pathway, including one novel locus in Ch12q24 encoding SH2B3 (rs3184504), which reached GWAS significance with a P value of 1.78 x 10(-8), and it showed an association with lung cancer (P = 2.01 x 10(-6)), colorectal cancer (GECCO P = 6.72x10(-6); CORECT P = 3.32x10(-5)), and breast cancer (P = .009). We also identified five key subpathway components with genetic variants that are relevant for the risk of these five cancer sites: inflammatory response for colorectal cancer (P = .006), inflammation related cell cycle gene for lung cancer (P = 1.35x10(-6)), and activation of immune response for ovarian cancer (P = .009). In addition, sequence variations in immune system development played a role in breast cancer etiology (P = .001) and innate immune response was involved in the risk of both colorectal (P = .022) and ovarian cancer (P = .003).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Genetic variations in inflammation and its related subpathway components are keys to the development of lung, colorectal, ovary, and breast cancer, including SH2B3, which is associated with lung, colorectal, and breast cancer.},

abstract = {In observational studies, investigators have no control over the treatment assignment. The treated and non-treated (that is, control) groups may have large differences on their observed covariates, and these differences can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects. Even traditional covariance analysis adjustments may be inadequate to eliminate this bias. The propensity score, defined as the conditional probability of being treated given the covariates, can be used to balance the covariates in the two groups, and therefore reduce this bias. In order to estimate the propensity score, one must model the distribution of the treatment indicator variable given the observed covariates. Once estimated the propensity score can be used to reduce bias through matching, stratification (subclassification), regression adjustment, or some combination of all three. In this tutorial we discuss the uses of propensity score methods for bias reduction, give references to the literature and illustrate the uses through applied examples.},

abstract = {The nutritional benefits of fish consumption relate to the utilization of proteins of high biological value, as well as certain minerals and vitamins that fish provide. Fish or fish oil contains omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that appear to play several useful roles for human health. Conversely, some carcinogenic contaminants are also stored in the adipose tissue of fish. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the potential health benefits and risks related to the consumption of fish or fish oil. Health benefits related to the consumption of fish or omega-3 PUFAs were obtained by an extensive literature search. Potential health risks related to carcinogenic contaminants (e.g., dioxin, PCB, etc.) in fish were estimated using the U.S. EPA-approved cancer risk assessment guidelines. Potential health risk estimates were evaluated by comparing them with the acceptable excess risk level of 10-6-10-4. Scientific data indicate that the consumption of fish or fish oil containing omega-3 PUFAs reduces the risk of coronary heart disease, decreases mild hypertension, and prevents certain cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Risk estimates in humans for carcinogenic environmental contaminants in fish ranged from an excess risk level of 3×10-6-9×10-4. These risk estimates appeared to meet the acceptable excess risk level criteria. Therefore, consumption of fish in accordance with the State of Michigan Fish Advisory Guidelines is safe and should be encouraged. The top 11 fish species [e.g., sardines, mackerel, herring (Atlantic and Pacific), lake trout, salmon (Chinook, Atlantic, and Sockeye), anchovy (European), sablefish, and bluefish] provide an adequate amount of omega-3 PUFAs (2.7-7.5g/meal) and appear to meet the nutritional recommendation of the American Heart Association. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We have previously found marine n-3 fatty acids to be inversely related to post-menopausal breast cancer in Chinese women from Singapore. Post-menopausal women with high [quartiles 2-4 (Q2-Q4)] versus low [quartile 1 (Q1)] intake exhibited a statistically significant reduction in risk of breast cancer after adjustment for potential confounders [relative risk (RR) = 0.66, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.50, 0.87]. Experimental studies have demonstrated a direct role for the peroxidation products of marine n-3 fatty acids in breast cancer protection. There is a suggestion that the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) may be major catalysts in the elimination of these beneficial by-products. Therefore, we hypothesized that individuals possessing the low activity genotypes of GSTM1, GSTT1 and/or GSTP1 (i.e. the GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null and GSTP1 AB/BB genotypes, respectively) may exhibit a stronger marine n-3 fatty acid-breast cancer association than their high activity counterparts. The Singapore Chinese Health Study is a prospective investigation involving 35,298 middle-aged and older women, who were enrolled between April 1993 and December 1998. In this case-control analysis, nested within the Singapore Chinese Health Study, we compared 258 incident breast cancer cases with 670 cohort controls. Overall, breast cancer risk was unrelated to GSTM1 and GSTP1 genotypes. However, the GSTT1 null genotype was associated with a 30{\%} reduced risk of breast cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 0.71, 95{\%} CI = 0.52, 0.96]. Among women with high activity GST genotypes (i.e. GSTM1 positive, GSTT1 positive and GSTP1 AA), no marine n-3 fatty acid-breast cancer relationships were observed in either pre-menopausal or post-menopausal women at baseline. However, post-menopausal women possessing the combined GSTM1 null and GSTP1 AB/BB genotypes showed a statistically significant reduction in risk after adjustment for potential confounders (Q2-Q4 versus Q1, OR = 0.36, 95{\%} CI = 0.14, 0.94). A similar relationship was observed among women with the combined GSTT1 null and GSTP1 AB/BB genotypes (OR = 0.26, 95{\%} CI = 0.08, 0.78).},

abstract = {Many carcinogens have been shown to cause tissue specific tumors in animal models. The mechanism for this specificity has not been fully elucidated and is usually attributed to differences in organ metabolism. For heterocyclic amines, potent carcinogens that are formed in well-done meat, the ability to either bind to the estrogen receptor and activate or inhibit an estrogenic response will have a major impact on carcinogenicity. Here, we describe our work with the human estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), the mutagenic/carcinogenic heterocyclic amines PhIP, MeIQx, and IFP, and the hydroxylated metabolite of PhIP, N2-hydroxy-PhIP. We demonstrate both by computational docking and NMR analysis that PhIP binds with the ligand binding domain (LBD). This binding competes with estradiol (E2) in the native E2 binding cavity of the receptor. In vitro assays show that PhIP, in contrast to the other heterocyclic amines, increases cell proliferation in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and activates the ERalpha receptor. We also find that other heterocyclic amines and N2-hydroxy-PhIP inhibit ERalpha activation. We propose that the mechanism for the tissue-specific carcinogenicity seen in the rat breast tumors and the presumptive human breast cancer associated with the consumption of well-done meat maybe mediated by this receptor activation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Socioeconomic deprivation is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer mortality. This article summarizes the relationships between socioeconomic status (SES) and breast cancer in white European women compared with racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Furthermore, we examine the association between obesity and breast cancer within socioeconomic disparities. METHODS Mortality rates were published by the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Obesity data were derived from the National Center for Health Statistics Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. MEDLINE searches were performed using keywords, such as socioeconomic status, poverty, African American, Hispanic, race, and combined with related articles. RESULTS Socioeconomic deprivation may be responsible for the increased risk of breast cancer mortality in African American and Hispanic patients, as they are more likely than white American patients to be diagnosed with advanced disease. Among white women, social deprivation is related to poor breast cancer prognosis, with increased prevalence rates of high-grade, estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors, similar to that of triple-negative breast cancers observed in African American and Hispanic women. Obesity is associated with advanced breast cancer at diagnosis, high tumor proliferation rates, and more triple-negative phenotypes, indicating that it may adversely contribute to prognosis. CONCLUSIONS Most studies show an effect of SES on breast cancer incidence and prognosis. Research should focus on the influence of social deprivation on breast cancer characteristics, such as absence of ER expression, that occurs in African Americans and Hispanics and in white European women with a different genetic background.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, the inactivation of the cyclic nucleotide signal depends on a complex array of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Although it has been established that multiple PDE isoenzymes with distinct catalytic properties and regulations coexist in the same cell, the physiological significance of this remarkable complexity is poorly understood. To examine the role of a PDE in cAMP signaling in vivo, we have inactivated the type 4 cAMP-specific PDE (PDE4D) gene, a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila dunce. This isoenzyme is involved in feedback regulation of cAMP levels. Mice deficient in PDE4D exhibit delayed growth as well as reduced viability and female fertility. The decrease in fertility of the null female is caused by impaired ovulation and diminished sensitivity of the granulosa cells to gonadotropins. These pleiotropic phenotypes demonstrate that PDE4D plays a critical role in cAMP signaling and that the activity of this isoenzyme is required for the regulation of growth and fertility.},

MGMT Ile143Val polymorphism may lead to less DNA damage repair and increased cancer risk depending on the environmental exposures. We investigated interactions between dietary factors and the MGMT Ile143Val polymorphism in relation to breast, colorectal and prostate cancer risk. There were 276/1498, 273/2984 and 312/1486 cases/controls for the breast, colorectal and prostate cancer studies respectively; all nested within the EPIC-Norfolk study, a prospective cohort of approximately 25,000 men and women aged 40-79. Baseline 7-day food diary data were collected for dietary assessment. MGMT Ile143Val polymorphism was not overall associated with breast, colorectal and prostate cancer risk. There was a significant interaction between this polymorphism and intake of red and processed meat on colorectal cancer risk (Pinteraction= 0.04) suggesting an increased risk among carriers of the variant genotype compared to the MGMT Ile143Ile common genotype. A lower colorectal cancer risk was seen with higher intake of vitamin E and carotene among the variant genotype group but not in the common genotype group (Pinteraction= 0.009 and Pinteraction= 0.005 for vitamin E and carotene, respectively). A higher prostate cancer risk was seen with higher alcohol intake among the variant genotype (OR = 2.08, 95{\%} CI = 1.21-3.57, Pinteraction= 0.0009) compared to the common genotype with lower alcohol intake. In this UK population, the MGMT Ile143Val polymorphism was not overall associated with breast, colorectal and prostate cancer risk. There was evidence for this polymorphism playing a role in modulating the risk of prostate cancer in presence of alcohol. For colorectal cancer, the MGMT Ile143Val polymorphism may confer increased or decreased risk depending on the dietary exposure. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Chronic inflammation has been reported to be a risk factor for colorectal neoplasia. The propensity to mount an inflammatory response is modified by germ line variation in cytokine and other inflammation-related genes. We hypothesized that a proinflammatory genotype would be positively associated with colorectal adenoma, a precursor of colorectal cancer. We investigated the association of colorectal adenoma with 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms in a range of important proinflammatory (IL1B, IL6, IL8, TNF, and LTA) and anti-inflammatory (IL4, IL10, and IL13) cytokines and other inflammation-related genes (PTGS2 and PPARG) in a case-control study of risk factors for colorectal polyps in which all participants (ages 18-74 years) had undergone colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. The study sample comprised 244 cases of colorectal adenoma and 231 polyp-free controls. Compared with being homozygous for the common allele, heterozygosity at the IL1B -31 (C{\textgreater}T) locus was associated with an odds ratio (OR) for colorectal adenoma of 1.8 [95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI), 1.2-2.9]. Homozygous carriers of the IL8 -251-A allele were at 2.7-fold increased risk of adenoma (95{\%} CI, 1.5-4.9) compared with homozygosity for the common T allele, whereas carriage of at least one IL8 -251-A allele conferred a 1.5 increased odds of disease (95{\%} CI, 1.0-2.4). Among non-nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug users, there was a statistically significant association between the IL10 -819-T/T genotype and adenoma compared with the common IL10 -819-C/C genotype (OR, 3.9; 95{\%} CI, 1.1-13.6), which was not evident among nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug users (OR, 0.7; 95{\%} CI, 0.3-1.5; P(interaction) = 0.01).

Previously defined asthma subgroups were used for analysis: 1) older patients with low atopy and low lung function, 2) high atopy, 3) young non-smoking women and 4) high smoking history. Allele frequencies of 68 GWAS-nominated SNPs were compared between controls and cases or controls and subgroups of cases defined by cluster analysis. RESULTS Twelve GWAS-nominated SNPs demonstrated evidence of replication (p value {\textless} 0.05) for association with asthma. In phenotypically similar asthma patients, rs10197862, located in IL1RL1/IL18R1, was the most strongly associated SNP with the high atopy subgroup (p = 0.0009). SNPs located at the IL33 and the STARD3/PGAP3 loci were also associated with the high atopy subgroup. Two SNPs, rs1544791 (PDE4D) and rs3806932 (TSLP), were more strongly associated with the high smoking history subgroup than with asthma or any other subgroups. All 10 SNPs that replicated for asthma per se and within subgroups had lower p values in subgroups. Moreover, 12 SNPs were only replicated in a subgroup. CONCLUSION This study shows that the majority of GWAS-nominated SNPs are more strongly associated with homogeneous subgroups of asthma than broadly defined asthma.},

abstract = {A bulk of literature demonstrated that respiratory allergy, and especially asthma, is prevalent in males during childhood, while it becomes more frequent in females from adolescence, i.e., after menarche, to adulthood. The mechanisms underlying the difference between females and males are the effects on the immune response of female hormones and in particular the modulation of inflammatory response by estrogens, as well as the result of the activity of various cells, such as dendritic cells, innate lymphoid cells, Th1, Th2, T regulatory (Treg) and B regulatory (Bregs) cells, and a number of proteins and cytokines, which include interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13. As far as sexual dimorphism is concerned, a gender difference in the expression profiles of histamine receptors and of mast cells was demonstrated in experimental studies. A critical phase of hormone production is the menstrual cycle, which often is associated with asthma deterioration, as assessed by worsening of clinical symptoms and increase of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In asthmatic woman, there is a high risk to develop more severe asthma during menstruation. The higher prevalence of asthma in females is confirmed also in the post-menopause age, but the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood. In pregnancy, asthma may worsen but may also improve or remain unchanged, with no significant difference in frequency of these three outcomes. For allergic rhinitis, the available studies indicate, likewise asthma, a male predominance in prevalence in childhood that shifts to a female predominance in adolescence and adulthood, but further investigation is needed.},

abstract = {U.S. Latinas have a lower incidence of breast cancer compared with non-Latina White women. This difference is partially explained by differences in the prevalence of known risk factors. Genetic factors may also contribute to this difference in incidence. Latinas are an admixed population with most of their genetic ancestry from Europeans and Indigenous Americans. We used genetic markers to estimate the ancestry of Latina breast cancer cases and controls and assessed the association with genetic ancestry, adjusting for reproductive and other risk factors. We typed a set of 106 ancestry informative markers in 440 Latina women with breast cancer and 597 Latina controls from the San Francisco Bay area and estimated genetic ancestry using a maximum likelihood method. Odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI) for ancestry modeled as a continuous variable were estimated using logistic regression with known risk factors included as covariates. Higher European ancestry was associated with increased breast cancer risk. The OR for a 25{\%} increase in European ancestry was 1.79 (95{\%} CI, 1.28-2.79; P{\textless}0.001). When known risk factors and place of birth were adjusted for, the association with European ancestry was attenuated but remained statistically significant (OR, 1.39; 95{\%} CI, 1.06-2.11; P=0.013). Further work is needed to determine if the association is due to genetic differences between populations or possibly due to environmental factors not measured.},

abstract = {Although inconsistencies exist, some studies have shown that meat consumption is associated with breast cancer risk. Several heterocyclic amines (HAs), formed in the cooking of meats, are mammary carcinogens in laboratory models. HAs are activated by polymorphic N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) and rapid NAT2 activity may increase risk associated with HAs. We investigated whether ingestion of meat, chicken and fish, as well as particular concentrated sources of HAs, was associated with breast cancer risk, and if NAT2 genotype modified risk. Caucasian women with incident breast cancer (n = 740) and community controls (n = 810) were interviewed and administered a food frequency questionnaire. A subset of these women (n = 793) provided a blood sample. Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses were used to determine NAT2 genotype. Consumption of red meats, as well as an index of concentrated sources of HAs, was not associated with increased breast cancer risk, nor did risk vary by NAT2 genotype. In post-menopausal women, higher fish consumption was inversely associated with risk (odds ratio = 0.7; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.4-1.0); among pre-menopausal women, there was the suggestion of inverse associations between risk and pork and chicken intake. Our results suggest that consumption of meats and other concentrated sources of HAs is not associated with increased breast cancer risk. However, due to the strong biologic plausibility for a role of some HAs in mammary carcinogenesis, and the likely measurement error in evaluation of sources of HAs in this study, further studies of these possible relationships are warranted.},

abstract = {Meats cooked well-done by high temperature techniques produce mutagenic compounds such as heterocyclic amines (HCAs), but the amounts of these compounds vary by cooking techniques, temperature, time, and type of meat. We investigated the role of HCAs in the etiology of colorectal adenomas and the extent to which they may explain the previously observed risk for red meat and meat-cooking methods. In a case-control study of colorectal adenomas, cases (n = 146) were diagnosed with colorectal adenomas at sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and controls (n = 228) were found not to have colorectal adenomas at sigmoidoscopy. Using a meat-derived HCA and mutagen database and responses from a meat-cooking questionnaire module, we estimated intake of 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and mutagenic activity. We calculated odds ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals using logistic regression adjusting for several established risk factors for colorectal adenomas or cancer. The odds ratios (95{\%} confidence interval; P for trend test) fifth versus first quintiles are: 2.2 (1.2-4.1; P = 0.02) for DiMeIQx; 2.1 (1.0-4.3; P = 0.002) for MeIQx; 2.5(1.1-5.5; P = 0.02) for PhIP; and 3.1 (1.4-6.8; P = 0.001) for mutagenic activity. When the three HCAs were adjusted for the other two, only the trend for MeIQx (P = 0.04) remained statistically significant. When we tried to disentangle the relative contribution of the three HCAs from the meat variables, we found that MeIQx remained significantly associated with risk even when adjusted for red meat but not vice versa. When MeIQx and well-done meat were analyzed in the same model, the risks were attenuated for both. Mutagenic activity from meat remained significantly associated with increased risk even when adjusted for intake of red meat or well-done red meat, whereas the red meat and well-done red meat associations were no longer significant when adjusted for total mutagenic activity. In conclusion, we found an elevated risk of colorectal adenomas associated with high intake of certain HCAS: Further, mutagenic activity from cooked meat consumption, a measure that integrates all of the classes of mutagens, was strongly associated with risk and explained the excess risk with intake of well-done red meat.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Society for Nutrition. Background: High consumption of red and processed meats has been linked to higher chronic disease risk. It has been hypothesized that inflammation markers may mediate part of this association. Most previous studies on the association of red meat intake with circulating inflammation markers used C-reactive protein (CRP) but rarely other markers, and not all differentiated between processed meat and unprocessed red meat. Objective: We investigated the cross-sectional association of processed meat and unprocessed red meat consumption with plasma concentrations of CRP, interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$, soluble TNF receptor (sTNF-R) 1, and sTNF-R2 in German adults. Methods: Inflammationmarkers were quantified in the plasma of 553 adults (233men and 320 women) aged 18-80 y within the cross-sectional Bavarian Food Consumption Survey II. Dietary intake was estimated from three 24-h dietary recalls. The association between red meat consumption and inflammation markers was analyzed with the use of multivariable-adjusted linear regression. Results: Processed meat consumption was borderline significantly associated with higher IL-6 [relative difference per 50-g increment: 5{\%} (95{\%} CI: 21{\%}, 10{\%})] but not with CRP (2{\%}; 95{\%} CI: 26{\%}, 10{\%}), and it was inversely associated with total TNF-$\alpha$ (23{\%}; 95{\%} CI: 26{\%}, 21{\%}), sTNF-R1 (23{\%}; 95{\%} CI: 24{\%}, 21{\%}), and sTNF-R2 (22{\%}; 95{\%} CI: 24{\%}, 0{\%}) concentrations. Unprocessed redmeat consumptionwas not associatedwith CRP (25{\%}; 95{\%} CI:215{\%}, 5{\%}) or IL-6 (21{\%}; 95{\%} CI:29{\%}, 7{\%}) but was inversely associated with sTNF-R1 (23{\%}; 95{\%}CI:25{\%},21{\%}) and sTNF-R2 (24{\%}; 95{\%}CI:27{\%},22{\%}). Conclusions: Our results suggest an inverse association between both processed meat and unprocessed red meat with inflammation markers of the TNF pathway in Bavarian adults but no association with CRP. Further research on the role of TNF pathway markers in chronic inflammation is warranted.},

The predicted risk associated with each locus is generally modest (with a per-allele odds ratio typically less than 2) and so, presumably, are the functional effects of individual genetic variants conferring disease susceptibility. Perhaps the greatest challenge in the 'post-GWAS' era is to understand the functional consequences of these loci. Biological insights can then be translated to clinical benefits, including reliable biomarkers and effective strategies for screening and disease prevention. The purpose of this article is to propose principles for the initial functional characterization of cancer risk loci, with a focus on non-coding variants, and to define 'post-GWAS' functional characterization.},

To replicate these GWAS findings, we examined six selected polymorphisms from these regions and their relation with circulating 25(OH)D levels in 1,605 Hispanic women (629 U.S. Hispanics and 976 Mexicans) and 354 non-Hispanic White (NHW) women. We also assessed the potential interactions between these variants and known non-genetic predictors of 25(OH)D levels, including body mass index (BMI), sunlight exposure and vitamin D intake from diet and supplements. The minor alleles of the two GC polymorphisms (rs7041 and rs2282679) were significantly associated with lower 25(OH)D levels in both Hispanic and NHW women. The CYP2R1 polymorphism, rs2060793, also was significantly associated with 25(OH)D levels in both groups. We found no significant associations for the polymorphisms in the CYP24A1. In Hispanic controls, 25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with the rs12785878T and rs1790349G haplotype in the NADSYN1/DHCR7 region. Significant interactions between GC rs2282679 and BMI and between rs12785878 and time spent in outdoor activities were observed. These results provide further support for the contribution of common genetic variants to individual variability in circulating 25(OH)D levels. The observed interactions between SNPs and non-genetic factors warrant confirmation.},

Using a family-based study, we investigated whether polymorphisms in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) (ERCC1 3' untranslated region (UTR) G/T, XPD Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln, XPC intron 11 C/A, XPA 5' UTR C/T, XPF Arg415Gln and XPG Asp1104His) and mismatch repair (MLH1 Ile219Val and MSH2 Gly322Asp) pathways modified the association with red meat and poultry intake. We tested for gene-environment interactions using case-only analyses (n = 577) and compared the results using case-unaffected sibling comparisons (n = 307 sibships). Increased risk of CRC was observed for intake of more than or equal to three servings per week of red meat [odds ratio (OR) = 1.8, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 1.3-2.5)] or high-temperature cooked red meat (OR = 1.6, 95{\%} CI = 1.1-2.2). Intake of red meat heavily brown on the outside or inside increased CRC risk only among subjects who carried the XPD codon 751 Lys/Lys genotype (case-only interaction P = 0.006 and P = 0.001, respectively, for doneness outside or inside) or the XPD codon 312 Asp/Asp genotype (case-only interaction P = 0.090 and P {\textless} 0.001, respectively). These interactions were stronger for rectal cancer cases (heterogeneity test P = 0.002 for XPD Asp312Asn and P = 0.03 for XPD Lys751Gln) and remained statistically significant after accounting for multiple testing. Case-unaffected sibling analyses were generally supportive of the case-only results. These findings highlight the possible contribution of diets high in red meat to the formation of lesions that elicit the NER pathway, such as carcinogen-induced bulky adducts.},

abstract = {RANK ligand (RANKL) is crucial for the development of mouse mammary glands during pregnancy. RANKL functions as a major paracrine effector of the mitogenic action of progesterone in mammary epithelium via its receptor RANK and has a role in expansion and regenerative potential of mammary stem cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of RANKL attenuates the development of mammary carcinoma and inhibits metastatic progression in multiple mouse models. Primary breast carcinoma samples from the neoadjuvant GeparTrio study were analyzed to correlate the expression of human RANK and RANKL with pathological complete response (pCR), disease-free (DFS), and overall (OS) survival. Pre-treatment FFPE core biopsies (n = 601) were analyzed for percentage and intensity of immunohistochemical RANK and RANKL expression. Antibodies against human RANK (N-1H8; Amgen) and human RANKL (M366; Amgen) were used. RANK protein was expressed in 160 (27 {\%}) patients. Increased RANK expression was observed in 14.5 {\%} of patients and correlated with high tumor grade (p {\textless} 0.023) and negative hormone receptor (HR) status (p {\textless} 0.001). Patients with high RANK expression showed a higher pCR rate (23.0 {\%} vs. 12.6 {\%}, p = 0.010), shorter DFS (p = 0.038), and OS (p = 0.011). However, prognostic and predictive information was not an independent parameter. Only 6 {\%} of samples expressed RANKL, which was not correlated with any clinical features. Higher RANK expression in the primary tumor is associated with a higher sensitivity to chemotherapy, but also a higher risk of relapse and death. Our study provides a basis for further exploration of the antitumor activity of clinical antibodies against RANKL.},

The method holds equal promise for Latinos, who typically inherit a mix of European, Native American, and African ancestry. However, admixture mapping in Latinos has not been practical because of the lack of a map of ancestry-informative markers validated in Native American and other populations. To address this, we screened multiple databases, containing millions of markers, to identify 4,186 markers that were putatively informative for determining the ancestry of chromosomal segments in Latino populations. We experimentally validated each of these markers in at least 232 new Latino, European, Native American, and African samples, and we selected a subset of 1,649 markers to form an admixture map. An advantage of our strategy is that we focused our map on markers distinguishing Native American from other ancestries and restricted it to markers with very similar frequencies in Europeans and Africans, which decreased the number of markers needed and minimized the possibility of false disease associations. We evaluated the effectiveness of our map for localizing disease genes in four Latino populations from both North and South America.},

This approach incorporates the heterogeneity of effects in the analysis of the overall treatment efficacy. The model can be extended to include relevant covariates which would reduce the heterogeneity and allow for more specific therapeutic recommendations. We suggest a simple noniterative procedure for characterizing the distribution of treatment effects in a series of studies. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {Identifying gene and environment interaction (G × E) can provide insights into biological networks of complex diseases, identify novel genes that act synergistically with environmental factors, and inform risk prediction. However, despite the fact that hundreds of novel disease-associated loci have been identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), few G × Es have been discovered. One reason is that most studies are underpowered for detecting these interactions. Several new methods have been proposed to improve power for G × E analysis, but performance varies with scenario. In this article, we present a module-based approach to integrating various methods that exploits each method's most appealing aspects. There are three modules in our approach: (1) a screening module for prioritizing Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs); (2) a multiple comparison module for testing G × E; and (3) a G × E testing module. We combine all three of these modules and develop two novel "cocktail" methods. We demonstrate that the proposed cocktail methods maintain the type I error, and that the power tracks well with the best existing methods, despite that the best methods may be different under various scenarios and interaction models. For GWAS, where the true interaction models are unknown, methods like our "cocktail" methods that are powerful under a wide range of situations are particularly appealing. Broadly speaking, the modular approach is conceptually straightforward and computationally simple. It builds on common test statistics and is easily implemented without additional computational efforts. It also allows for an easy incorporation of new methods as they are developed. Our work provides a comprehensive and powerful tool for devising effective strategies for genome-wide detection of gene-environment interactions.},

abstract = {Chronic inflammation and infection are major causes of cancer. There are continued improvements to our understanding of the molecular connections between inflammation and cancer. Key mediators of inflammation-induced cancer include nuclear factor kappa B, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, inflammatory cytokines, prostaglandins and specific microRNAs. The collective activity of these mediators is largely responsible for either a pro-tumorigenic or anti-tumorigenic inflammatory response through changes in cell proliferation, cell death, cellular senescence, DNA mutation rates, DNA methylation and angiogenesis. As our understanding grows, inflammatory mediators will provide opportunities to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In this review, we provide a general overview of the connection between inflammation, microRNAs and cancer and highlight how our improved understanding of these connections may provide novel preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to reduce the health burden of cancer.},
