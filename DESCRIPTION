Description: Tools to run genome-wide association study (GWAS) and
  genome-wide by environment interaction study (GWEIS) scans using the genetic
  data stored in a binary dosage file. The user provides a data frame with
  the subject's covariate data and the information about the binary dosage
  file returned by the BinaryDosage::getbdinfo() routine.
